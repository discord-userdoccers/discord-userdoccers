# Phone Verification

Discord allows users to add a phone number to their account for various purposes, such as account security, verification, and contact syncing.
There are a few different flows for phone verification, depending on the context in which the phone number is being used.

## Registering with a Phone Number

When registering a new account, users can provide a phone number to verify their account. This flow is outlined in the [account registration documentation](/authentication#phone-registration).

## Adding a Phone Number

Users can add a phone number to their account at any time. This may be required for certain features, or, in some cases, for [anti-abuse purposes](/resources/user#required-action-type).

To add a phone number, clients must first send a request to the [Add Phone Number](#add-phone-number) endpoint with the phone number the user wishes to add, and preferrably a reason for the change. This will send a verification code to the phone number via SMS.
After the user receives the code, clients must then use the [Verify Phone Number](#verify-phone-number) endpoint with the phone number and the code to receive a phone verification token.
After receiving the token, clients can then use the [Add Phone Number](#add-phone-number) endpoint again, providing the verification token, the user's password, and the same reason to complete the process.

<Alert type="info">

Phone numbers can only be associated with one Discord account at a time. Adding a phone number that is already associated with another account may result in the phone number being removed from the other account.
Registering a new account with a phone number that is already associated with another account will fail, and the user will need to remove the phone number from the other account first.

</Alert>

## Reverifying a Phone Number

Users may be prompted to reverify their phone number for [anti-abuse purposes](/resources/user#required-action-type).

In this case, clients must follow the same flow as [adding a phone number](#adding-a-phone-number), but instead of the [Add Phone Number](#add-phone-number) endpoint, they must use the [Reverify Phone Number](#reverify-phone-number) endpoint.

## Removing a Phone Number

Users can remove a phone number from their account at any time. Note that if a phone number was added for anti-abuse purposes, the user may be required to add a new phone number before they can continue using their account.

To remove a phone number, clients must send a request to the [Remove Phone Number](#remove-phone-number) endpoint with the user's password and an optional reason for removing the phone number.
