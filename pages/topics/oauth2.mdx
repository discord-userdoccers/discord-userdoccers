# OAuth2

OAuth2 enables application developers to build applications that utilize authentication and data from the Discord API. Within Discord, there are multiple types of OAuth2 authentication.
Supported grants include the authorization code grant, implicit grant, device grant, client credentials, and some modified special-for-Discord flows for bots and webhooks.

## Shared Resources

The first step in implementing OAuth2 is [registering a developer application](/resources/application#create-application) and retrieving your client ID and client secret.
Most people who will be implementing OAuth2 will want to find and utilize a library in the language of their choice. For those implementing OAuth2 from scratch, please see [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for details.
After you create your application with Discord, make sure that you have your `client_id` and `client_secret` handy. The next step is to figure out which OAuth2 flow is right for your purposes.

###### OAuth2 URLs

| URL                                             | Description                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize            | Authorization URL                                           |
| https://discord.com/activate                    | Device Code Authorization URL                               |
| https://discord.com/api/v10/oauth2/token        | Token URL                                                   |
| https://discord.com/api/v10/oauth2/token/revoke | [Token Revocation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009) URL |
| https://discord.com/api/v10/oauth2/keys         | JWKS URI                                                    |
| https://discord.com/api/v10/oauth2/userinfo     | UserInfo URL                                                |

<Alert type="warn">

In accordance with the relevant RFCs, the token and token revocation URLs will **only** accept a content type of `x-www-form-urlencoded`. JSON content is not permitted and will return an error.

Likewise, these endpoints will usually not return typical Discord error responses, opting for RFC-compliant formats.

</Alert>

###### OAuth2 Scopes

These are all the OAuth2 scopes that Discord supports. Some scopes require approval from Discord to use. Requesting them from a user without approval from Discord will lead to unexpected error behavior in the OAuth2 flow.

<Alert type="info">

`bot` and `guilds.join` require you to have a bot account linked to your application. Also, in order to add a user to a guild, your bot has to already belong to that guild.

^1^ Required unless the basic [bot authorization flow](#bot-authorization-flow) is used.

^2^ If the `bot` scope is selected, the `applications.commands` scope is automatically added to the authorization by official clients.

^3^ If a `response_type` is specified and no `redirect_uri` is specified, the user will be redirected to the first registered redirect URI for the application.

^4^ Only accepts `true` or `false`.

## State and Security

Before we dive into the semantics of the different OAuth2 grants, we should stop and discuss security, specifically the use of the `state` parameter.
[Cross Site Request Forgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery), or CSRF, and [Clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking) are security vulnerabilities that must be addressed by individuals implementing OAuth.
This is typically accomplished using the `state` parameter. `state` is sent in the authorization request and returned back in the response and should be a value that binds the user's request to their authenticated state.
For example, `state` could be a hash of the user's session cookie, or some other nonce that can be linked to the user's session.

When a user begins an authorization flow on the client, a `state` is generated that is unique to that user's request. This value is stored somewhere only accessible to the client and the user, i.e. protected by the [same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy).
When the user is redirected, the `state` parameter is returned. The client validates the request by checking that the `state` returned matches the stored value. If they match, it is a valid authorization request.
If they do not match, it's possible that someone intercepted the request or otherwise falsely authorized themselves to another user's resources, and the request should be denied.

For OpenID Connect, the `nonce` parameter may be used in a similar way instead. Upon receiving the ID token, the client should validate that the `nonce` claim in the ID token matches the `nonce` sent in the authorization request.

While Discord does not require the use of the `state` parameter, we highly recommend that you implement it for the security of your own applications and data.

## Authorization Code Grant

The authorization code grant is what most developers will recognize as "standard OAuth2" and involves retrieving an access code and exchanging it for a user's access token.
It allows the authorization server to act as an intermediary between the client and the resource owner, so the resource owner's credentials are never shared directly with the client.

###### Example Authorization URL

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=157730590492196864&scope=identify%20guilds.join&state=15773059ghq9183habn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnicememe.website&prompt=consent&integration_type=0
```

When someone navigates to this URL, they will be prompted to authorize your application for the requested scopes.
On acceptance, they will be redirected to your `redirect_uri`, which will contain an additional query-string parameter, `code`. `state` will also be returned if previously sent, and should be validated at this point.

`prompt` controls how the authorization flow handles existing authorizations. If a user has previously authorized your application with the requested scopes and prompt is set to `consent`, it will request them to reapprove their authorization.
If set to `none`, it will skip the authorization screen and redirect them back to your redirect URI without requesting their authorization. For passthrough scopes, like `bot` and `webhook.incoming`, authorization is always required.

The `integration_type` parameter specifies the [installation context](/resources/application#application-integration-type) for the authorization. The installation context determines where the application will be installed, and is only relevant when `scope` contains `applications.commands`.
When set to `GUILD_INSTALL`, the application will be authorized for installation to a guild. When set to `USER_INSTALL`, the application will be authorized for installation to a user. The application must be configured to support the provided `integration_type`.

###### Example Redirect URL

```
https://nicememe.website/?code=NhhvTDYsFcdgNLnnLijcl7Ku7bEEeee&state=15773059ghq9183habn
```

`code` is now exchanged for the user's access token by making a request to the [token URL](#oauth2-urls) as follows:

###### Example Access Token Exchange

```py
API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = '332269999912132097'
CLIENT_SECRET = '937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire'
REDIRECT_URI = 'https://nicememe.website'

def exchange_code(code):
  data = {
    'client_id': CLIENT_ID,
    'client_secret': CLIENT_SECRET,
    'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
    'code': code,
    'redirect_uri': REDIRECT_URI
  }
  headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  }
  r = requests.post('%s/oauth2/token' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers)
  r.raise_for_status()
  return r.json()
```

In response, you will receive an [access token response](#oauth2-access-token-object):

###### Example Access Token

```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "access_token": "ODkxNDM2MjMzOTAzOTY0MTYx.6qrZcUqja7812RVdnEKjpzOL4CvHBFG",
  "scope": "identify",
  "expires_in": 604800,
  "refresh_token": "D43f5y0ahjqew82jZ4NViEr2YafMKhue"
}
```

Having the user's access token allows your application to make certain requests to the API on their behalf, restricted to whatever scopes were requested.

## Refresh Token Grant

`expires_in` is how long, in seconds, until the returned access token expires, allowing you to anticipate the expiration and refresh the token. To refresh, make another request to the [token URL](#oauth2-urls) with the following parameters:

###### Example Refresh Token Exchange

```py
API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = '332269999912132097'
CLIENT_SECRET = '937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire'
REDIRECT_URI = 'https://nicememe.website'

def refresh_token(refresh_token):
  data = {
    'client_id': CLIENT_ID,
    'client_secret': CLIENT_SECRET,
    'grant_type': 'refresh_token',
    'refresh_token': refresh_token
  }
  headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  }
  r = requests.post('%s/oauth2/token' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers)
  r.raise_for_status()
  return r.json()
```

Boom; fresh [access token response](#oauth2-access-token-object)!

## Implicit Grant

The implicit OAuth2 grant is a simplified flow optimized for in-browser clients. Instead of issuing the client an authorization code to be exchanged for an access token, the client is directly issued an access token. The URL is formatted as follows:

###### Example Authorization URL

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=290926444748734499&scope=identify&state=15773059ghq9183habn
```

On redirect, your redirect URI will contain additional **URI fragments** representing a serialiazed [access token response](#oauth2-access-token-object): `access_token`, `token_type`, `expires_in`, `scope`, and [`state`](#state-and-security) (if specified).
**These are not query string parameters.** Be mindful of the "#" character:

###### Example Redirect URL

```
https://findingfakeurlsisprettyhard.tv/#access_token=RTfP0OK99U3kbRtHOoKLmJbOn45PjL&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=604800&scope=identify&state=15773059ghq9183habn
```

There are tradeoffs in using the implicit grant flow. It is both quicker and easier to implement, but rather than exchanging a code and getting a token returned in a secure HTTP body, the access token is returned in the URI fragment, which makes it possibly exposed to unauthorized parties.
**You also are not returned a refresh token, so the user must explicitly reauthorize once their token expires.**

## Client Credentials Grant

The client credential flow is a quick and easy way for bot developers to get their own bearer tokens for testing purposes. By making a request to the [token URL](#oauth2-urls) with a grant type of `client_credentials`,
you will be returned an access token for the bot owner. Therefore, always be super-extra-very-we-are-not-kidding-like-really-be-secure-make-sure-your-info-is-not-in-your-source-code careful with your `client_id` and `client_secret`. We don't take kindly to imposters around these parts.

You can specify scopes with the `scope` parameter, which is a list of [OAuth2 scopes](#oauth2-scopes) separated by spaces:

###### Example Client Credentials Request

```py
API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = '332269999912132097'
CLIENT_SECRET = '937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire'

def get_token():
  data = {
    'client_id': CLIENT_ID,
    'client_secret': CLIENT_SECRET,
    'grant_type': 'client_credentials',
    'scope': 'identify connections'
  }
  headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  }
  r = requests.post('%s/oauth2/token' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers)
  r.raise_for_status()
  return r.json()
```

In return, you will receive an access token (without a refresh token):

###### Example Access Token

```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "access_token": "6qrZcUqja7812RVdnEKjpzOL4CvHBFG",
  "scope": "identify connections",
  "expires_in": 604800
}
```

Note that team-owned applications are limited to the scopes `applications.builds.read`, `applications.builds.upload`, `applications.commands.update`, `applications.entitlements`, `applications.store.update`, and `identify`.
This is because these applications are owned by a pseudo-user that is not meant to be operated like a normal user account.

## Device Code Grant

The device code grant is a flow that allows users to authenticate on devices that do not have a web browser or are otherwise unable to complete the OAuth2 flow in a traditional way.

To use the device code grant, you first need to make a request to the [device code authorize URL](#oauth2-urls) to retrieve a device code and user code:

###### Example Device Code Request

```py
API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = '332269999912132097'
CLIENT_SECRET = '937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire'

def get_device_code():
  data = {
    'client_id': CLIENT_ID,
    'client_secret': CLIENT_SECRET,
    'scope': 'identify connections'
  }
  headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  }
  r = requests.post('%s/oauth2/device/authorize' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers)
  r.raise_for_status()
  return r.json()
```

In return, you will receive a response containing the necessary information to start the authorization process:

###### Example Device Code Response

```json
{
  "device_code": "PZVqIuLlME19uotfsUATN65Ytgbejbhj7Eob8qzali",
  "user_code": "ZAW6C586",
  "verification_uri": "https://discord.com/activate",
  "verification_uri_complete": "https://discord.com/activate?user_code=ZAW6C586",
  "expires_in": 300,
  "interval": 5
}
```

You should display the `user_code` and `verification_uri` to the user, or embed the `verification_uri_complete` link in a QR code for them to scan.

While you are prompting the user, you should also start polling the [token URL](#oauth2-urls) to check if the user has completed the authorization process every `interval` seconds or until the `expires_in` time has passed:

###### Example Device Code Exchange

```py
API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = '332269999912132097'
CLIENT_SECRET = '937it3ow87i4ery69876wqire'

def exchange_device_code(device_code):
  data = {
    'client_id': CLIENT_ID,
    'client_secret': CLIENT_SECRET,
    'grant_type': 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code',
    'device_code': device_code
  }
  headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  }
  r = requests.post('%s/oauth2/token' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers)
  if r.status_code == 200:
    return r.json()
  elif r.status_code == 400:
    data = r.json()
    if r['error'] == 'authorization_pending':
      # The user has not yet completed the authorization process
      return None
    elif r['error'] == 'slow_down':
      # Increase the polling interval
      return None
    elif r['error'] == 'expired_token':
      # The device code has expired, you need to request a new one
      raise Exception('The device code has expired, please request a new one')
    elif r['error'] == 'access_denied':
      # The user has denied the authorization request
      raise Exception('The user has denied the authorization request')
  r.raise_for_status()
```

If the user has completed the authorization process, you will receive an [access token response](#oauth2-access-token-object) as usual.

## PKCE

Discord supports the [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) extension to the OAuth2 authorization code flow.

PKCE allows users to authenticate with your application without sharing your client secret.
This enables user-facing applications such as browser extensions or mobile apps to manage authentication securely.
The flow runs entirely between the user and Discord, allowing users to refresh their own bearer tokens without needing your application's client secret.

If you want your clients to be able to refresh their own tokens automatically, you will need to [enable the `PUBLIC_OAUTH2_CLIENT` application flag](/resources/application#application-flags).

When using PKCE, your application can also utilize custom schemes in [`redirect_uris`](/resources/application#application-object).

### Code Verifier

Firstly, the client needs to create a code verifier, `code_verifier`:

- The verifier must be a string of 43 - 128 characters.
- The characters must be alphanumeric (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`) and hyphens `-`, periods `.`, underscores `_`, and tildes `~`.
- The code verifier must also be randomly generated for each authorization request.

The PKCE specification recommends that you generate a 32 byte random string and base64 URL encode it without padding, resulting in a 43-byte string.

```py
code_verifier = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(os.urandom(32)).rstrip(b'=').decode('utf-8')
```

### Code Challenge

Next, the client needs to create a code challenge, `code_challenge`, which is the base64 URL-encoded SHA256 hash of the `code_verifier`, without padding.

SHA256 is the only supported hashing algorithm for PKCE in Discord's OAuth2 implementation.

```py
sha256 = hashlib.sha256(code_verifier.encode('utf-8')).digest()
code_challenge = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(sha256).decode('utf-8').rstrip('=')
```

The client then constructs the authorization URL with the `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method` parameters:

### Example Authorization URL

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=290926444748734499&scope=identify&code_challenge=CNPVOxIUDw5vcUaWT3Gn8fjrEeZs-kMEqpk2eNzqsmQ&code_challenge_method=S256&state=15773059ghq9183habn
```

If successful, Discord will send you to the redirect URL with the usual authorization code.
The redirect URL can safely be forwarded to the client, as the `code_challenge` is not sensitive information. However, it is also acceptable to keep the credentials on the server instead.

When exchanging the authorization code for an access token, the client must include the `code_verifier` in the request. Note that to omit the `client_secret` field as shown below, you must have the [`PUBLIC_OAUTH2_CLIENT` application flag](/resources/application#application-flags) set.

###### Example Access Token Exchange

```py
API_ENDPOINT = 'https://discord.com/api/v10'
CLIENT_ID = '332269999912132097'
CODE_VERIFIER = 'Qs-0Scio0ScPJDYOFy1NYsOAsj6Rb6cP-Y12N9pbwV0'
REDIRECT_URI = 'https://nicememe.website'

def exchange_code(code):
  data = {
    'client_id': CLIENT_ID,
    'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
    'code': code,
    'code_verifier': CODE_VERIFIER,
    'redirect_uri': REDIRECT_URI
  }
  headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
  }
  r = requests.post('%s/oauth2/token' % API_ENDPOINT, data=data, headers=headers)
  r.raise_for_status()
  return r.json()
```

This will give you an [access token response](#oauth2-access-token-object) as usual.
You can now [refresh the token](#refresh-token-grant) on the client, omitting the `client_secret` field depending on the [`PUBLIC_OAUTH2_CLIENT` application flag](/resources/application#application-flags).

## Bots

So, what are bot accounts?

### Bot vs User Accounts

Discord's API provides a separate type of user account dedicated to automation, called a bot account. Bot accounts can be created through the [applications API](/resources/application) and do not have an email and password.
Unlike the normal OAuth2 flow, bot accounts have full access to all API routes without using bearer tokens, and can connect to the [Real Time Gateway](/topics/gateway).
Automating normal user accounts (generally called "self-bots") outside of the OAuth2/bot API is forbidden, and can result in an account termination if found. Don't get found :)

Bot accounts have a few differences in comparison to normal user accounts, namely:

1. Bots are added to guilds through the OAuth2 API, and cannot accept normal invites.
2. Bots cannot have friends, nor be added to or join Group DMs.
3. Verified bots do not have a maximum number of Guilds.
4. Bots have an entirely separate set of [Rate Limits](/topics/rate-limits#rate-limits).

### Bot Authorization Flow

Bot authorization is a special server-less and callback-less OAuth2 flow that makes it easy for users to add bots to guilds. The URL you create looks similar to what we use for full stack implementation:

###### Example Authorization URL

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=157730590492196864&scope=bot&permissions=1
```

In the case of bots, the `scope` parameter should be set to `bot`. There's also a new parameter, `permissions`, which is an integer corresponding to the [permission calculations](/topics/permissions#bitwise-permission-flags) for the bot.
You'll also notice the absence of `response_type` and `redirect_uri`. Bot authorization does not require these parameters because there is no need to retrieve the user's access token.

When the user navigates to this page, they'll be prompted to add the bot to a guild in which they have proper permissions. On acceptance, the bot will be added. Super easy!

If you happen to already know the ID of the guild the user will add your bot to, you can provide this ID in the URL as a `guild_id=GUILD_ID` parameter.
When the authorization page loads, that guild will be preselected in the dialog if that user has permissions to add the bot to that guild. You can use this in conjunction with the parameter `disable_guild_select=true` to disallow the user from picking a different guild.

If your bot is super specific to your private clubhouse, or you just don't like sharing, you can make sure [`integration_public` is disabled on your application](/resources/application#application-object). If unchecked, only you can add the bot to guilds.
If marked as public, anyone with your bot's ID can add it to guilds in which they have proper permissions.

### Advanced Bot Authorization

Devs can extend the bot authorization functionality. You can request additional scopes outside of `bot`, which will prompt a continuation into a complete [authorization code grant flow](#authorization-code-grant) and add the ability to request the user's access token.
If you request any scopes outside of `bot` or `applications.commands`, `response_type` is again mandatory.

When receiving the access code on redirect, there will be additional query-string parameters of `guild_id` and `permissions`.
**These parameters should only be used as hints, as they are easily faked by malicious users.** To be sure of the relationship between your bot and the guild, consider [enabling `integration_require_code_grant` on your application](/resources/application#application-object).
Enabling it requires anyone adding your bot to a guild to go through a full OAuth2 [authorization code grant flow](#authorization-code-grant), meaning the integration will not be created until your backend [exchanges the code for a token](#example-access-token-exchange).
When you retrieve the user's access token, you'll also receive information about the guild to which your bot was added through an additional `guild` object in the response.

### Multi-Factor Authentication Requirement

For bots with [elevated permissions](/topics/permissions#bitwise-permission-flags) (permissions with a `*` next to them), we enforce multi-factor authentication on the owner's account when added to guilds that have guild-wide MFA enabled.

## Webhooks

Discord's webhook flow is a specialized version of an [authorization code](#authorization-code-grant) implementation. In this case, the `scope` query-string parameter needs to include `webhook.incoming`:

###### Example Authorization URL

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=157730590492196864&scope=webhook.incoming&state=15773059ghq9183habn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fnicememe.website
```

When the user navigates to this URL, they will be prompted to select a channel in which to allow the webhook. When the webhook is [executed](/resources/webhook#execute-webhook), it will post its message into this channel.
On acceptance, the user will be redirected to your `redirect_uri`. The URL will contain the `code` query-string parameter which should be [exchanged for an access token](#example-access-token-exchange) as usual.
In return, you will receive a slightly modified token response, with an additional `webhook` object:

###### Example Access Token

```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "access_token": "GNaVzEtATqdh173tNHEXY9ZYAuhiYxvy",
  "scope": "webhook.incoming",
  "expires_in": 604800,
  "refresh_token": "PvPL7ELyMDc1836457XCDh1Y8jPbRm",
  "webhook": {
    "type": 1,
    "id": "347114750880120863",
    "name": "Application Name Here",
    "avatar": "cc7e0aa58a4224a281fbb8217b808a72",
    "channel_id": "345626669224982402",
    "guild_id": "290926792226357250",
    "application_id": "310954232226357250",
    "token": "kKDdjXa1g9tKNs0-_yOwLyALC9gydEWP6gr9sHabuK1vuofjhQDDnlOclJeRIvYK-pj_",
    "url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/347114750880120863/kKDdjXa1g9tKNs0-_yOwLyALC9gydEWP6gr9sHabuK1vuofjhQDDnlOclJeRIvYK-pj_"
  }
}
```

From this object, you should store the `webhook.id` and `webhook.token`. See the [execute webhook](/resources/webhook#execute-webhook) documentation for how to send messages with the webhook.

Any user that wishes to add your webhook to their channel will need to go through the full OAuth2 flow, and a new webhook is created each time. If you wish to send a message to all your webhooks,
you'll need to iterate over each stored `id:token` combination and make `POST` requests to each one. Be mindful of our [Rate Limits](/topics/rate-limits#rate-limits)!

When attempting to authenticate a provisional account that has been merged with a user account, the request will fail with a 400 bad request and a special error response body:

```json
{
  "message": "User account is non-provisional and should be authed through OAuth2",
  "code": 530010,
  "user_id": "1001086404203389018",
  "provider_type": "OIDC",
  "provider_id": "https://auth.example.com",
  "provider_issued_user_id": "123456789"
}
```

This indicates that the provisional account has been merged with a user account, and the user should be authenticated through OAuth2 instead, unless the provisional account is [unmerged](#unmerge-provisional-account) first.

</Alert>

<Collapsible title="Display Names" description="How are provisional account display names determined?" icon="question">

- For [bot-issued tokens](#get-provisional-account-token-with-bot), the `preferred_global_name` specified will be used.
- For OIDC, a provisional account's display name will be the value of the `preferred_username` claim, if specified in
  the ID token. This field is optional and should be between 1 and 32 characters. If not specified, the user's display
  name will default to the user's unique username, which Discord generates on creation.
- For [Steam session tickets](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/auth), the display name of the user's Steam
  account is used as the provisional account's display name.
- For [EOS Auth](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-account-services/auth/auth-interface) Access Tokens or ID Tokens,
  the name of the user's Epic account is used as the provisional account's display name. EOS Connect ID Tokens do
  not expose any username, and thus the game will need to configure the display name manually.
- For [Unity Services ID Tokens](https://services.docs.unity.com/docs/client-auth/),
  the display name of the user's Unity Player Account is used as the provisional account's display name.
- For [Apple ID Tokens](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi),
  the name of the user's Apple ID account is used as the provisional account's display name.
- For PlayStation Network ID Tokens, the name of the user's PlayStation Network account is used as the provisional account's display name.

To change the display name of a provisional account, use the [Modify Current User Account](/resources/user#modify-current-user-account) endpoint.
