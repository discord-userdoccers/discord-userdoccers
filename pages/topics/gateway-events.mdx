# Gateway Events

Gateway connections are WebSockets, meaning they're bidirectional and either side of the WebSocket can send events to the other. The following events are split up into two types:

- **Send events** are Gateway events sent by a client to Discord (like when identifying with the Gateway)
- **Receive events** are Gateway events that are sent by Discord to a client. These events typically represent something happening inside of a guild where the user is a member of, like a channel being updated.

All Gateway events are encapsulated in a [Gateway payload](#gateway-payload-structure).

For more information about interacting with the Gateway, you can reference the [Gateway documentation](/topics/gateway).

### Event Names

In practice, event names are UPPER-CASED with under_scores joining each word in the name. For instance, [Channel Create](#channel-create) would be `CHANNEL_CREATE` and [Voice State Update](#voice-state-update) would be `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE`.

For readability, event names in the following documentation are typically left in Title Case.

### Gateway Payload Structure

Gateway event payloads have a common structure, but the contents of the associated data (`d`) varies between the different events.

| Field  | Type        | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| op     | integer     | [Gateway Opcode](/topics/opcodes-and-status-codes#gateway-opcodes), which indicates the payload type                                   |
| d      | ?JSON value | Event data                                                                                                                             |
| s? ^1^ | ?integer    | Sequence number of event used for [resuming sessions](/topics/gateway#resuming) and [heartbeating](/topics/gateway#sending-heartbeats) |
| t? ^1^ | ?string     | Event name for this payload (`DISPATCH` Opcode only)                                                                                   |

^1^ These fields are received only, and `null` when the `op` is not `DISPATCH`.

###### Example Gateway Payload (Send)

```json
{
  "op": 2,
  "d": {}
}
```

###### Example Gateway Payload (Receive)

```json
{
  "op": 0,
  "d": {},
  "s": 42,
  "t": "GATEWAY_EVENT_NAME"
}
```

## Send Events

Send events are Gateway events encapsulated in an [event payload](#gateway-payload-structure), and are sent by a client to Discord through a Gateway connection.

  }
}
```

#### Heartbeat

Used to maintain an active Gateway connection. Must be sent every `heartbeat_interval` milliseconds after the [Opcode 10 Hello](#hello) payload is received. The inner `d` key is the last sequence number—`s`—received by the client. If you have not yet received one, send `null`. Fires a [Heartbeat ACK](#heartbeat-ack) Gateway event.

Details about heartbeats are in the [Gateway documentation](/topics/gateway#sending-heartbeats).

###### Example Heartbeat

```json
{
  "op": 1,
  "d": 251

```

#### Update Presence

Sent by the client to indicate a presence update.

<Alert type="warn">

Clients may only update their presence 5 times per 20 seconds.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warn">

All incoming Gateway events will be paused until the updated presence is propagated.

</Alert>

```

#### Request Guild Members

Used to request all members for a guild or a list of guilds. When initially connecting, if you don't have the `GUILD_PRESENCES` [Gateway intent](/topics/gateway#gateway-intents), or if the guild is over 75k members, it will only send members who are in voice, plus the member for you (the connecting user). Otherwise, if a guild has over `large_threshold` members (value in the [Gateway Identify](#identify)), it will only send members who are online, have a role, have a nickname, or are in a voice channel, and if it has under `large_threshold` members, it will send all members. If a client wishes to receive additional members, they need to explicitly request them via this operation. Fires multiple [Guild Members Chunk](#guild-members-chunk) events with up to 1000 members per chunk until all members that match the request have been sent.

Due to our privacy and infrastructural concerns with this feature, there are some limitations that apply:

- For bots, the `GUILD_PRESENCES` privileged intent is required to request presences
- For bots, the `GUILD_MEMBERS` privileged intent is required to request the entire member list (query of "" and limit of 0)
- For users, the `MANAGE_ROLES`, `KICK_MEMBERS`, or `BAN_MEMBERS` permissions are required to request the entire member list (query of "" and limit of 0)
- For bots, only one guild ID may be requested at a time
- Requesting a prefix (`query` parameter) will return a maximum of 100 members
- `user_ids` will be limited to 100 members

#### Request Call Connect

Used to request a private channel's pre-existing call data, created before the Gateway connection was established. Fires a [Call Create](#call-create) Gateway event if a call is found.

<Alert type="info">

When using the `AUTO_CALL_CONNECT` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities), it is no longer necessary to explicitly request a call connect. Instead, the client will automatically receive [Call Create](#call-create) events for pre-existing calls upon connecting to the Gateway.

## Receive Events

Received events are Gateway events encapsulated in an [event payload](#gateway-payload-structure), and are sent by Discord to a client through a Gateway connection. Most received events correspond to dispatch events that happen relevant to the current user and the guilds it is a member of.

| Name                                | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| [Heartbeat ACK](#heartbeat-ack)     | Acknowledges a received client heartbeat                                                                      |
| [Reconnect](#reconnect)             | Indicates the server is going away, client should reconnect to Gateway and [resume](/topics/gateway#resuming) |
| [Invalid Session](#invalid-session) | Failure response to [Identify](#identify) or [Resume](#resume), or indicates an invalid active session        |
| [Dispatch](#dispatch-events)        | Dispatches an event to the client                                                                             |

#### Hello

Sent on connection to the WebSocket. Defines the heartbeat interval that the client should heartbeat to.

| Field              | Type          | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \_trace            | array[string] | An array of stringified JSON values representing the connection trace, used for debugging |
| heartbeat_interval | integer       | The interval (in milliseconds) the client should heartbeat at                             |

###### Example Hello

```json
{
  "op": 10,
  "d": {
    "heartbeat_interval": 41250,
    "_trace": ["[\"gateway-prd-us-east1-c-6w69\",{\"micros\":0.0}]"]
  },
  "s": null,
  "t": null
}
```

#### Heartbeat ACK

Sent in response to receiving a heartbeat to acknowledge that it has been received.

Details about heartbeats are in the [Gateway documentation](/topics/gateway#sending-heartbeats).

###### Example Heartbeat ACK

```json
{
  "op": 11,
  "d": null,
  "s": null,
  "t": null
}
```

#### Reconnect

The reconnect event is dispatched when a client should reconnect to the Gateway (and resume their existing session, if they have one). This event usually occurs during deploys to migrate sessions gracefully off old hosts.

###### Example Reconnect

```json
{
  "op": 7,
  "d": null,
  "s": null,
  "t": null
}
```

#### Invalid Session

Sent to indicate one of at least three different situations:

- The Gateway could not initialize a session after receiving an [Opcode 2 Identify](#identify)
- The Gateway could not resume a previous session after receiving an [Opcode 6 Resume](#resume)
- The Gateway has invalidated an active session and is requesting client action

The inner `d` key is a boolean that indicates whether the session may be resumable. See [Connecting](/topics/gateway#connecting) and [Resuming](/topics/gateway#resuming) for more information.

###### Example Invalid Session

```json
{
  "op": 9,
  "d": false,
  "s": null,
  "t": null
}
```

## Dispatch Events

These events directly correspond with a specific action or state change that has occurred in the platform.

^1^ Feature is not available to or not tracked for bots. This field may be empty, omitted, or `null`.

^2^ For bots, guilds start out as unavailable when they connect to the Gateway. As they become available, the bot will be notified via [Guild Create](#guild-create) events.

^3^ Requires the `AUTH_TOKEN_REFRESH` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities).

^4^ Omitted when using the `USER_SETTINGS_PROTO` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities).

^5^ Omitted when using the `LAZY_USER_NOTES` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities).

^6^ When using the `DEDUPE_USER_OBJECTS` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities), `presences`, as well as each guild's `presences` array, is replaced by `merged_presences`. In addition, each guild's `members` array will be collapsed into `merged_members`. Finally, the `users` array will contain the user objects for every user in the event. Any user object in the event will be omitted, with an ID left in its place (e.g. `user_id` in [member](/resources/guild#guild-member-object) objects, `recipient_ids` in [private channel](/resources/channel#channel-object) objects, etc.).

^7^ When using the `PRIORITIZED_READY_PAYLOAD` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities), `merged_members` in Ready will only include the client's [member](/resources/guild#guild-member-object) object for each guild. The rest will be sent in the [Ready Supplemental](#ready-supplemental) event. See the [gateway guild](#gateway-guild-object) object documentation for more information about included data.

^8^ The tutorial state is cleared after a period of inactivity. A `null` tutorial means no indicators will be shown.

^9^ The field will be a [versioned array](#versioned-structure) if the `VERSIONED_USER_GUILD_SETTINGS` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities) is enabled. Otherwise, it will be a regular array.

^1^ For bots without the `GUILD_PRESENCES` [Gateway intent](/topics/gateway#gateway-intents), user accounts, or guilds with over 75k members, this will only include the client's member and users in voice channels. User accounts additionally receive [friends and implicit relationships](/resources/relationships#relationship-object) (depending on the [`NO_AFFINE_USER_IDS` Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities)), as well as users they have an open DM with.

^2^ User accounts only receive presences for non-offline [friends and implicit relationships](/resources/relationships#relationship-object) (depending on the [`NO_AFFINE_USER_IDS` Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities)), as well as users they have an open DM with. Bots with the `GUILD_PRESENCES` [Gateway intent](/topics/gateway#gateway-intents) receive all presences.

^3^ User accounts are only synced threads they have been added to. Bots are synced all threads.

^4^ Omitted when using the `PRIORITIZED_READY_PAYLOAD` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities).

^5^ Requires the `CLIENT_STATE_V2` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities). Without the capability, the `properties` field will be merged into the main object, along with the rest of the extended attributes.

^6^ Geo-restricted guilds will also be marked as unavailable and will not be joinable or accessable.

### Messages

<Alert type="warn">

Unlike persistent messages, ephemeral messages are sent directly to the user and the bot who sent the message rather than through the guild channel. Because of this, ephemeral messages are tied to the [`DIRECT_MESSAGES` intent](/topics/gateway#list-of-intents), and the message object won't include `guild_id` or `member`.

### Presence

#### Presence Update

This event is sent when a user's presence or info, such as name or avatar, is updated. The inner payload is a [presence](/resources/presence#presence-object) object.

For user accounts, this event is only sent for presences they are subscribed to. Users are automatically subscribed to the overall user presence and every per-guild presence of [friends and implicit relationships](/resources/relationships#relationship-object) (depending on the `NO_AFFINE_USER_IDS` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities)), as well as every per-guild presences of users they have an open DM with.

<Alert type="warn">

If you are using [Gateway Intents](/topics/gateway#gateway-intents), you _must_ specify the `GUILD_PRESENCES` intent in order to receive Presence Update events.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warn">

Presence Update events are never received for the user's own presence. You _must_ track your own presence locally, or via the [Sessions Replace](#sessions-replace) event.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warn">

The `user` object within this event can be very partial. The only field which is guaranteed is the `id` field, everything else is optional.
Along with this limitation, no fields are required, and the types of the fields are **not** validated. Your client should expect any combination of fields and types within this event.
