# Opcodes and Status Codes

## Gateway

All Gateway events in Discord are tagged with an opcode that denotes the payload type. Your connection to the Gateway may also sometimes close. When it does, you will receive a close code that tells you what happened.

## HTTP

The API will return semantically valid HTTP response codes based on the success of your request. The following table can be used as a reference for response codes it will return.

###### HTTP Response Codes

| Code                        | Meaning                                                                                                    |

| 202 (ACCEPTED)              | The request was accepted but the resource is not ready. A `retry_after` key should be present in the body. |
| 204 (NO CONTENT)            | The request completed successfully but returned no content.                                                |
| 304 (NOT MODIFIED)          | The entity was not modified (no action was taken).                                                         |
| 400 (BAD REQUEST)           | The request was improperly formatted, or the server couldn't understand it.                                |

| 422 (UNPROCESSABLE CONTENT) | The request was well-formed but failed validation (Rust services only).                                    |
| 429 (TOO MANY REQUESTS)     | You are being rate limited, see [Rate Limits](/topics/rate-limits).                                        |
| 501 (NOT IMPLEMENTED)       | The requested HTTP method is not supported.                                                                |

^1^ 502, 504, 507, 522, 523, 524 should be retried with a backoff. The number of failed requests can be specified with the `X-Failed-Requests` header. Whether you retry other 5xx errors is up to you.

## JSON

Along with the HTTP error code, the API can also return more detailed error codes through a `code` key in the JSON error response. The response will also contain a `message` key containing a more friendly error string. Some of these errors may include additional details in the form of [Error Messages](/reference#error-messages) provided by an `errors` object.

<Alert type="info">

A special `40333` JSON error code is returned if your request is blocked by Cloudflare. This may be due to a malformed request or improper user agent. The response resembles a normal error structure but is not thrown by the API itself:

```json
{
  "message": "internal network error",
  "code": 40333
}
```
