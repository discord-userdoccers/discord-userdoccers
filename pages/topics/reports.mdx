# Reports

Discord has a [reporting system](https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord) that allows users to report messages or profiles that violate Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).
When a user creates a report, it is sent to Discord's Trust and Safety team for review. The team evaluates the report and takes appropriate action, which may include warning the user, temporarily suspending their account, or permanently banning them from the platform.

There are multiple versions of the reporting API:

- [**V1**](#reports-v1): The original version of the reporting API, also known as dirt. Supports reporting messages and users.
- [**V2**](#reports-v2): An updated version of the original reporting API that includes detailed report types and saves a snapshot of the reported message for review. Supports reporting messages only.
- [**V3**](#reports-v3): The latest version of the reporting API, known as in-app reports, that includes additional report types and improved functionality. Supports reporting messages, users, guilds, scheduled events, and more.
- [**DSA**](#dsa): A special version of reports V3 that can be used by users living in the European Union to comply with the [Digital Services Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act).

## Considerations

When using the reporting API, keep the following in mind:

- Only resources you have access to can be reported. For example, you cannot report a message in a private channel you cannot access.
- You must have a verified email on your account to create reports.
- You cannot report your own messages or profile.
- Reports are anonymous. The user being reported will not be notified of who reported them.
- Abuse of the reporting system may result in action being taken against your account.

## Reports V1

### DSA

A special version of reports V3 that can be used by users living in the European Union to comply with the [Digital Services Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act).
Unlike regular reports, DSA reports do not require an account to submit. Instead, users simply need to [verify an email address](#verify-unauthenticated-report).
Additionally, instead of the standard [report menu types](#report-menu-type), DSA reporters fetch their allowed report types from [a separate endpoint](#get-unauthenticated-report-capabilities).

Note that the unauthenticated reporting endpoints require that either authentication or a [fingerprint](/topics/experiments#fingerprints) is provided for experiment tracking purposes.
