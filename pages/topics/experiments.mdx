# Experiments

Experiments are a form of A/B testing used by Discord in the client- and server-side of their applications to serve
different experiences or behaviours to different users randomly and/or based on location, client version, etc.

At their core, rollouts are simply YAML inputted into the Discord admin panel; however, not all of the data
is required by clients. Therefore, the actual experiments clients see are minified and complex to decipher.

## Fingerprints

Even the marketing website uses A/B tests to hook users into the app. Therefore, the app needs a unique way to identify the
person using the website without using authentication (for users initially visiting the landing page), so it resorts to using
"fingerprints".

These aren't the usual fingerprints generated by collecting information about the browser; instead, they are snowflakes generated
by unauthenticated requests to [Get Experiment Assignments](#get-experiment-assignments). It is expected that fingerprints are sent
in the `X-Fingerprint` header in all subsequent requests to the API until authentication, in order to track A/B tests and allow
access to API-locked portions of experiments.

A fingerprint is comprised of a snowflake and a hashed cryptographic value. It looks like this: `1084179945133187083.JQddgNMmwJPghoBtFmaH7jTmdsw`.

When registering a new account, the fingerprint is passed, and (if valid) is used as the created user's ID. This is done in order
to preserve experiments across to the registered user. Therefore, a user account's creation time theoretically represents the first
time they visited Discord's marketing website.

## Rollouts

Experiment rollouts are defined in _populations_ based on the user or guild's [rollout position](#rollout-positions)
and can have _filters_ to narrow each population's availability.

###### Example Rollout

```md
2023-02_stage_boosting (1816004721)

### Treatment 1

Filters

Guild Features: [COMMUNITY]
Member Count Range: 1000 - null
Hash Range: Hash Key: 1816004721, Target: 10000

Position Ranges

5000-9500, 9500-10000

### Control

Filters

Guild Features: [COMMUNITY]
Member Count Range: 1000 - null

Position Ranges

0 - 10000

### None

Position Ranges

0 - 10000
```

### Treatments

`Control` and `None` are represented in the API as the integer values `0` and `-1`, respectively. Just as a warning, there are some instances of experiments having specific unnecessary treatments
labelled as `Control` indexed as `1`.

### Rollout Positions

A rollout position is calculated using the following pseudo code, where `exp_name` is the human readable name for the experiment and `resource_id` is the user, fingerprint or guild's ID.
This position is used in conjunction with the rollout populations and filters to figure out what the assigned bucket for the experiments are by simply checking which treatment the population is included in.

```py
result = mmh3.hash('exp_name:resource_id', signed=False) % 10000
```

## Data Structures

There are two types of experiments, user experiments and guild experiments. Metadata and human-readable experiment names
are available in the user-facing clients. However, API objects do not contain such data, except for guild experiments which may have a human-readable name provided for hash calculations, overriding the one in clients.

Most of the below objects are represented as arrays following the order the fields are documented in.

### User Experiments

User experiment data returned by the API is very limited. In contrast to the wide range of data the API provides for
guild rollouts, the only values we can programmatically retrieve from the API are the user or [fingerprint](#fingerprints)'s assigned
bucket for the experiment.

<Alert type="warn">

User experiments are subject to the same functionality and filters as guild experiments, despite only the calculated final data being provided.

</Alert>

###### User Experiment Structure

This object is represented as an array of the following fields:

| Field                | Type     | Description                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| hash                 | integer  | 32-bit unsigned Murmur3 hash of the experiment's name                                                     |
| revision             | integer  | Current version of the rollout                                                                            |
| bucket               | integer  | The requesting user or fingerprint's assigned experiment bucket                                           |
| override             | integer  | Whether the user or fingerprint has an override for the experiment (`-1` for false, `0` for true)         |
| population           | integer  | The internal population group the requesting user or fingerprint is in                                    |
| hash_result          | integer  | The calculated [rollout position](#rollout-positions) to use, prioritized over local calculations         |
| aa_mode ^1^          | integer  | The experiment's A/A testing mode, represented as an integer-casted boolean                               |
| trigger_debugging    | integer  | Whether the experiment's analytics trigger debugging is enabled, represented as an integer-casted boolean |
| holdout_name ^2^     | ?string  | A human-readable experiment name (formatted as `year-month_name`) that disables the experiment            |
| holdout_revision ^2^ | ?integer | The revision of the holdout experiment                                                                    |
| holdout_bucket ^2^   | ?integer | The requesting user or fingerprint's assigned bucket for the holdout experiment                           |

^1^ The bucket for A/A tested experiments should always be None (`-1`) unless an override is present for the resource.

^2^ Holdout information is only present if the user or fingerprint has an assigned bucket for the holdout experiment.
Therefore, if holdout experiment information is present and the population bucket is set to None (`-1`), the experiment has been disabled by the holdout.
As user experiments are opaque, no client handling is required for this field. Just follow the `population` field as usual.

###### Example User Experiment

```json
[826493636, 3, -1, -1, 0, 203, 0, 1, "2025-02_user_profile_editing", 2, 0]
```

### Guild Experiments

The data provided here is more detailed, because the client has to figure out itself the assigned bucket for each guild. It may
seem daunting to parse this given the sheer amount of arrays, but it's really quite simple.

<Alert type="warn">

While rare, there have been cases in the past of guild experiments used to control group DM rollouts. In these cases, the API remains entirely the same, but filters that cannot apply to group DMs are not used.
An example of this is the `2025-04_gdm_bedazzling` experiment.

### Experiment Population Filters Object

This object defines the filters required to be eligible for the ranges. All provided filters must be satisfied for the resource to be eligible for the given bucket.

The filters are an object represented as an array of arrays. The first item in the nested array is a 32-bit unsigned Murmur3 hashed representation of the key, and the second item is the value, with the value being another array-represented object. All structures below are represented in this way.

<Alert type="info">

The field order for filter structures (other than the top-level structure below) is guaranteed to be in the same order as documented.

### Experiment Bucket Override Object

An override represents a manual setting by Discord employees to grant a guild early or specific access to an experiment.

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/experiments">
  Get Experiment Assignments
</RouteHeader>

Returns the [user experiment assignments](#user-experiments) and optionally [guild experiment rollouts](#guild-experiments) for the user or fingerprint.

<Alert type="info">

Returned experiments are dependent on the requesting [client properties](/reference#client-properties).

</Alert>

<Alert type="warn">

A fingerprint will only be generated and returned if no authorization or fingerprint is provided in request headers. Fingerprint generation has a rate limit of 3 valid fingerprints per 2 minutes per IP. While fingerprints will still be returned past this rate limit, they will not be valid.
