# Email Verification

Discord accounts typically require email verification to unlock full functionality. While this is usually done during account registration, users can add or change their email address at any time.

## Registering with an Email Address

When registering a new account, users typically provide an email address to verify their account during the [standard registration process](/authentication#register).

## Adding an Email Address

Users can add an email address to their account at any time. This is required for certain features, or, in some cases, for [anti-abuse purposes](/resources/user#required-action-type). Having an email address associated with your account is recommended.

To add an email address, clients must first send a request to the [Modify Current User](/resources/user#modify-current-user) endpoint with the email address the user wishes to add.
This will send a verification link to the email address that redirects to the official Discord client with a verification token present in the URL's fragment (e.g. `https://discord.com/verify#token=eyJpZCI6ODUyODkyMjk3NjYxOTA2OTkzLCJlbWFpbCI6Im5lbGx5QGRpc2NvcmRhcHAuY29tIn0.Z6pQDg.pKCZBaaiodflO6FZhdttm6B_z74`).
After receiving the token, clients can then procede to [verify the change](#verify-email-address) to complete the process.

## Changing Your Email Address

Users can change their email address at any time.If the current email address is verified, the user will need to have access to it to initiate the change.
In this case, clients must first send a request to the [Send Email Change Challenge](#send-email-change-challenge) endpoint, which will send a verification code to the user's current email address.
After receiving the code, clients can then send a request to the [Verify Email Change Code](#verify-email-change-code) endpoint with the code to receive a verification token that can be used to change the user's email address via the [Modify Current User](/resources/user#modify-current-user) endpoint.

If the current email address is not verified, clients can directly send a request to the [Modify Current User](/resources/user#modify-current-user) endpoint with the new email address, similar to [adding an email address](#adding-an-email-address).

Finally, the user must verify the new email address as outlined in the [above flow](#adding-an-email-address).

## Reverifying Your Email Address

Users may be prompted to reverify their email address for [anti-abuse purposes](/resources/user#required-action-type).

In this case, a verification link will be automatically sent to the email address on file. If the user has not received a link, clients can [choose to resend it](#resend-verification-email).
The link should be used to verify the email address as outlined in the [adding an email address](#adding-an-email-address) flow.

## Removing Your Email Address

Users cannot remove the registered email address from their account. Instead, they must [change it to a new one](#changing-your-email-address) or [delete their account entirely](/resources/user#delete-user-account).
