# Introduction

You’ve found the Discord Developer Documentation! These pages are dedicated to showing you all the ways that you can use Discord to make cool stuff. Whether you’re looking to create awesome bots for your community, empower your applications with our API, or hook us right into your game with Rich Presence or the GameSDK, Discord has something for you.

All of our [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs) and we &lt;3 corrections and improvements!

## Bugs

If you believe you're experiencing a bug with our API or want to report incorrect documentation, open an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/issues).

## Bots and Apps

Bots and apps are the lifeblood of the Discord development community. They come in all shapes and sizes, from small hobby projects for your server with friends, to huge projects that live in hundreds of thousands of servers. We love seeing the unique, fun, and sometimes downright strange (in a good way) creations that come from our community.

Discord offers an open API to serve requests for both bots and OAuth2 integrations. So whether you’re making your own [`/wumpus` commands](/interactions/application-commands/) or looking to [`Log In With Discord`](/topics/oauth2/), we’ve got you covered.

So go do it! Go! Go [make an app](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create something awesome.

## Games

We love games, and we love helping game developers. If YOU have a game that you want to supercharge with Discord, then we have just the thing for you.

#### Your Game On Discord

If you haven’t yet noticed, Discord allows you to [sell your game](https://discord.com/sell-your-game) right from Discord servers! We’ve got a whole suite of tools to help bring your game to life on Discord. Need networking? Have [networking](/game-sdk/networking/)! Want a friends list? Take [relationships](/game-sdk/relationships/) too!

#### Rich Presence

No matter where your game lives, it should have a first-class experience in Discord. [Rich Presence](https://discord.com/rich-presence) is the way to make that a reality! We got tired of exchanging usernames, friend codes, and lobby passwords, so we created Rich Presence, an easy-to-use, easy-to-integrate way to get people playing games together that lets you:

- Display rich game data on your players’ profiles
- Empower them to send game invites to each other
- Ask to Join and Spectate their friends' games
- Spend more time playing together and less time setting up

It’s free, easy, and self-serve, so check out [the GameSDK Activity Manager](/game-sdk/activities/) and get started!

## Go Make Cool Stuff!

We love our developers, and we plan to keep making practical tools so that YOU can keep making cool stuff. Build a bot, integrate our account system, or put us right in your game; whatever you do, do it with Discord.

We can’t wait to see what you make.
