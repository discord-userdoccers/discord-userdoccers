# Introduction

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Overview">

You’ve found the Unofficial Discord User API Documentation! These pages are dedicated to showing you all the ways that you can use Discord to make cool stuff. It is not an official source of information. Automating user accounts is against the platform Terms of Service, so just a heads up: doing so unsafely might get you banned.

While we try our best to not publish any information without basis, quite a lot of the documentation contents are based off of reverse engineering and educated guesses. This means inaccuracies may be present. All of our [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/discord-userdoccers/discord-userdoccers) and we &lt;3 corrections and improvements!

<Alert type="info">

The success of this project depends on the community’s contributions. If you have any knowledge of the Discord API, please consider contributing to this project. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/discord-userdoccers/discord-userdoccers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

</Alert>

## Scope

This documentation is not affiliated with or endorsed by Discord in any way. It is a community effort to document the user side of the Discord API, which is not officially supported, as used by the [official client](https://discord.com/app) and [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

This means this documentation is focused on the API as it is used by non-bot users, namely with user and bearer authentication tokens. **While bot endpoints may be documented, how bots interact with the API is not the focus of this documentation.**

If bots, interactions, and a semblance of a guarantee that your API endpoint won't break are what you’re looking for, head over to [Discord’s official documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

## Bugs

If you believe you’re experiencing a bug with **a bot-accessible part of the API**, open an issue in the [official documentation issue tracker](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/issues).

## Go Make Cool Stuff!

Discord offers an open API to serve requests for users, bots, and OAuth2 integrations. So whether you’re making your own `!userinfo` command or looking to [rickroll someone](/topics/voice-connections), it has you covered.

So go do it! Go! Go [make an account](/authentication#register) and do something awesome.

## Changelog

<Changelog>
<ChangelogEntry date="January 23, 2026" version="AMOLED Theme">

We added a brand new AMOLED theme for those with OLED screens!

</ChangelogEntry>

<ChangelogEntry date="January 8, 2026" version="MCP Support">

Userdoccers now exposes an MCP server through its Algolia integration.
This allows users to access the documentation through an MCP client, allowing AI assistants to read and understand the documentation more easily.

Access now at: `https://mcp.us.algolia.com/1/BcFbCoAgEADAEwmuj13FryKC_O8A6ipEVKBE128mTnFf1jhvJhiPunGy7FxGtI2qQi0lMEEGRS3wMcrTWbyj9lL7EFfqJz_fHYCQvEJL8AM/mcp`

</ChangelogEntry>

<ChangelogEntry date="December 16, 2025" version="Endpoint Tester">

We introduced an endpoint tester tool to help users experiment with API endpoints directly from the documentation!
Access it by hovering over any endpoint and clicking the "Test" button.

Note that this unfortunately only works with user and bearer tokens due to Discord API restrictions.

</ChangelogEntry>

<ChangelogEntry date="November 14, 2025" version="Improved Search">

Algolia DocSearch has been upgraded to a newer version, bringing with it a slew of improvements, noticeably the addition of AI assistance to help you find what you're looking for faster.

The AI assistant, lovingly referred to as Doxy, is powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash and has access to documentation search results.
Keep in mind that it's still AI and may not always provide accurate information, so it's always a good idea to double-check the results it provides.

</ChangelogEntry>

<ChangelogEntry date="July 2, 2025" version="Error Codes">

We added a new section documenting Discord's JSON error codes and their meanings, searchable and grouped by category.
Access it [here](/topics/errors#json-error-codes)!

As Discord has a very vast collection of error codes that is impossible for us to cover exhaustively,
the page also allows users to submit new error codes they encounter to help expand the documentation.

</ChangelogEntry>

<ChangelogEntry date="April 28, 2025" version="Codegen for Tables">

We introduced code generation for a variety of languages directly on tables. It currently supports the following tables:

- Structures, request bodies, and response bodies: generates an interface representing the structure.
- Enums and flags: generates an enum representing the values.

To use it, hover over any applicable table and click the copy button that appears in the top-right corner.
You can use the language selector to choose your desired programming language.

Note that this feature is currently in an alpha state and may output incorrect or incomplete code.
While it shows up on all tables in the documentation, using it on unsupported tables may lead to unexpected results.
