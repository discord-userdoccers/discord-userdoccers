# Introduction

You’ve found the Unofficial Discord User API Documentation! These pages are dedicated to showing you all the ways that you can use Discord to make cool stuff. It is not an official source of information. Automating user accounts is against the platform Terms of Service, so just a heads up: doing so unsafely might get you banned.

While we try our best to not publish any information without basis, quite a lot of the documentation contents are based off of reverse engineering and educated guesses. This means inaccuracies may be present. All of our [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/discord-userdoccers/discord-userdoccers) and we <3 corrections and improvements!

<Alert type="info">

The success of this project depends on the community’s contributions. If you have any knowledge of the Discord API, please consider contributing to this project. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/discord-userdoccers/discord-userdoccers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

</Alert>

## Scope

This documentation is not affiliated with or endorsed by Discord in any way. It is a community effort to document the unsupported user side of the Discord API, used by the [official client](https://discord.com/app) and [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), amongst others.

This means this documentation is focused on the API as it is used by non-bot users, namely with user and bearer authentication tokens. **Most bot-only endpoints, and other functionality that is not usable with user/bearer tokens is generally out of scope and will not be focused on.**

If bots, interactions, and ~~guaranteed non-breaking APIs~~ are what you’re looking for, head over to [Discord’s official documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

## Bugs

If you believe you’re experiencing a bug with **a public, bot-accessible part of the API**, open an issue in the [official documentation issue tracker](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/issues).

## Go Make Cool Stuff!

Discord offers an open API to serve requests for users, bots, and OAuth2 integrations. So whether you’re making your own `!userinfo` command or looking to [rickroll someone](/topics/voice-connections), it has you (mostly) covered.

So go do it! Go! Go [make an account](/authentication#register) and do something awesome.
