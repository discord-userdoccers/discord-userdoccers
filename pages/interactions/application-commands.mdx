# Application Commands

Application commands are commands that an application can register to Discord. They provide users a first-class way of interacting directly with your application that feels deeply integrated into Discord.

###### Application Command Naming

`CHAT_INPUT` and `PRIMARY_ENTRY_POINT` command names and command option names must match the regex `^[-_'\p{L}\p{N}\p{sc=Deva}\p{sc=Thai}]{1,32}$` with the unicode flag set. If there is a lowercase variant of any letters used, you must use those.
Characters with no lowercase variants and uncased letters are still allowed. `USER` and `MESSAGE` commands may be mixed case and can include spaces.

## Authorizing Your Application

Application commands do not depend on a bot user in the guild; they use the [interactions](/interactions/receiving-and-responding) model. To create commands in a guild, your application must be authorized with the `applications.commands` scope.

<Alert type="info">

Requesting the `bot` scope will implicitly direct the client to request the `applications.commands` scope as well.

</Alert>

When requesting this scope, Discord "shortcuts" the OAuth2 flow similar to adding a bot. You don't need to complete the flow, exchange for a token, or any of that.

If your application does not require a bot user within the guild for its commands to work, **you no longer need to add for the bot scope or specific permissions**.

## Registering a Command

<Alert type="info">

Commands can only be registered via HTTP endpoint.

</Alert>

Commands can be scoped either globally or to a specific guild. Global commands are available for every guild that adds your app. An individual app's global commands are also available in DMs if that app has a bot that shares a mutual guild with the user.

Guild commands are specific to the guild you specify when making them. Guild commands are not available in DMs. Command names are unique per application, per type, within each scope (global and guild). That means:

- Your app **cannot** have two global `CHAT_INPUT` commands with the same name
- Your app **cannot** have two guild `CHAT_INPUT` commands within the same name **on the same guild**
- Your app **cannot** have two global `USER` commands with the same name
- Your app **can** have a global and guild `CHAT_INPUT` command with the same name
- Your app **can** have a global `CHAT_INPUT` and `USER` command with the same name
- Multiple apps **can** have commands with the same names

This list is non-exhaustive. In general, remember that command names must be unique per application, per type, and within each scope (global and guild).

An app can have the following number of commands:

- 100 global `CHAT_INPUT` commands
- 5 global `USER` commands
- 5 global `MESSAGE` commands

As well as the same amount of guild-specific commands per guild.

<Alert type="danger">

There is a global rate limit of 200 application command creates per day, per guild.

</Alert>

<Collapsible title="Making a Global Command" description="Simple example of making a global command" icon="code">

Global commands are available on _all_ your app's guilds.

Global commands have inherent read-repair functionality. That means that if you make an update to a global command, and an user tries to use that command before it has updated for them, Discord will do an internal version check and reject the command, and trigger a reload for that command.

To make a **global** command, make an HTTP POST call like this:

```py
import requests

url = "https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/<my_application_id>/commands"

# This is an example CHAT_INPUT or Slash Command, with a type of 1
json = {
    "name": "blep",
    "type": 1,
    "description": "Send a random adorable animal photo",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "animal",
            "description": "The type of animal",
            "type": 3,
            "required": True,
            "choices": [
                {
                    "name": "Dog",
                    "value": "animal_dog"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Cat",
                    "value": "animal_cat"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Penguin",
                    "value": "animal_penguin"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "only_smol",
            "description": "Whether to show only baby animals",
            "type": 5,
            "required": False
        }
    ]
}

# For authorization, you can use either your bot token
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bot <my_bot_token>"
}

# or a client credentials token for your app with the applications.commands.update scope
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <my_credentials_token>"
}

r = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json)
```

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Making a Guild Command" description="Simple example of making a guild command" icon="code">

Guild commands are available only within the guild specified on creation.

To make a **guild** command, make a similar HTTP POST call, but scope it to a specific `guild_id`:

```py
import requests

url = "https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/<my_application_id>/guilds/<guild_id>/commands"

# This is an example USER command, with a type of 2
json = {
    "name": "High Five",
    "type": 2
}

# For authorization, you can use either your bot token
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bot <my_bot_token>"
}

# or a client credentials token for your app with the applications.commands.update scope
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <my_credentials_token>"
}

r = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json)
```

## Updating and Deleting a Command

Commands can be deleted and updated by making `DELETE` and `PATCH` calls to the command endpoint. Those endpoints are

- `/applications/{application.id}/commands/{command.id}` for global commands, or
- `/applications/{application.id}/guilds/{guild.id}/commands/{command.id}` for guild commands

Because commands have unique names within a type and scope, Discord treats `POST` requests for new commands as upserts. That means **making a new command with an already-used name for your application will update the existing command**.

Full documentation of endpoints can be found [here](#endpoints).

## Contexts

Commands have two sets of contexts on the [application command object](#application-command-object) that let you to configure when and where it can be used:

- `integration_types` defines the **[installation contexts](#installation-context)** that a command supports
- `contexts` defines the **[interaction contexts](#interaction-context)** where a command can be used

Details for both types of command contexts are in the sections below.

<Alert type="info">

Contexts are distinct from, and do not affect, any [command permissions](#permissions) for applications in a guild.

</Alert>

### Installation Context

The [installation context](/resources/application#application-integration-type) is where your app was installed—to a guild, a user, or both. If your app supports both installation contexts, there may be cases where you want some of your app's commands to only be available for one or the other.
For example, maybe your app has a `/profile` command that is only relevant when it's installed to a user.

A command's supported installation context(s) can be set using the [`integration_types` field](#application-command-object) when creating or updating a command as long as any included contexts are already [supported by the application's `integration_types`](/resources/application#application-object).

### Interaction Context

The interaction contexts for a command determines where it can be used, and can be configured by setting the [`contexts` field](#application-command-object) when creating or updating a command.

There are three [interaction context types](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-context-type) that correspond to different surfaces: `GUILD`, `BOT_DM`, and `PRIVATE_CHANNEL`. However, the `PRIVATE_CHANNEL` interaction context is only meaningful for commands installed to a user (when the command's `integration_types` includes `USER_INSTALL`).

## Permissions

Application command permissions allow commands to be configured on an individual basis for up to 100 users, roles, and channels within a guild.

<Alert type="warn">

Command permissions cannot be updated using a bot.

</Alert>

A command's current permissions can be retrieved using the [`GET /applications/{application.id}/guilds/{guild.id}/commands/{command.id}/permissions`](#get-application-command-permissions) endpoint. The response will include a `permissions` arrau with associated IDs and permission types.

Command permissions can be updated with the [`PUT /applications/{application.id}/guilds/{guild.id}/commands/{command.id}/permissions`](#modify-application-command-permissions) endpoint by a user with sufficient permissions.
For their permissions to be considered sufficient, all of the following must be true:

- Has [permission to `MANAGE_GUILD` and `MANAGE_ROLES`](/topics/permissions) in the guild where the command is being edited
- Has the ability to run the command being edited
- Has permission to manage the resources that will be affected (roles, users, and/or channels depending on the [permission types](#application-command-permission-type))

^1^ When the `id` field is the application ID instead of a command ID, the permissions apply to all commands the application provides that do not otherwise have explicit overwrites.

###### Application Command Permissions Structure

Application command permissions allow you to enable or disable commands for specific users or roles within a guild.

| Field      | Type      | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id         | snowflake | The ID of the role or user                                                                       |
| type       | integer   | The type of the [application command permission overwrite](#application-command-permission-type) |
| permission | boolean   | Whether the command is allowed to be invoked by the entity                                       |

###### Application Command Permissions Constants

The following constants can be used in the `id` field for command permissions payloads.

| Permission   | Value          | Type      | Description             |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| `@everyone`  | `guild_id`     | snowflake | All members in a guild  |
| All Channels | `guild_id - 1` | snowflake | All channels in a guild |

###### Application Command Permission Type

| Value | Name    | Description              |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| 1     | ROLE    | A role within a guild    |
| 2     | USER    | A guild member           |
| 3     | CHANNEL | A channel within a guild |

To allow for fine-tuned access to commands, application command permissions are supported for guild and global commands of all types. Guild members and apps with the [necessary permissions](#permissions) can allow or deny specific users and roles from using a command, or toggle commands for entire channels.

Similar to how threads [inherit user and role permissions from the parent channel](topics/threads#permissions), any command permissions for a channel will apply to the threads it contains.

<Alert type="info">

If you don't have permission to use a command, it will not show up in the command index. Members with the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission can use all commands.

</Alert>

###### Using Default Permissions

Default permissions can be added to a command during creation using the `default_member_permissions` and `context` fields. This is the only opportunity for bots to configure permissions on commands, as per-guild command permissions must be configured by a user account or through OAuth2.

The `default_member_permissions` field can be used when creating a command to set the permissions a user must have to use it.
The value for `default_member_permissions` is a bitwise OR-ed set of [permissions](topics/permissions#bitwise-permission-flags), serialized as a string.
Setting it to `0` will prohibit anyone in a guild from using the command unless a specific overwrite is configured or the user has admin permissions.

You can also include `BOT_DM` in `contexts` when setting a global command's [interaction contexts](#interaction-context) to control whether it can be run in DMs with your bot. Guild commands don't support the `BOT_DM` interaction context.

###### Example of Editing Permissions

<Collapsible title="Example of Editing Permissions" description="Simple example of editing command permissions" icon="code">

As an example, the following command would not be usable by anyone except admins in any guilds by default:

```json
{
  "name": "permissions_test",
  "description": "A test of default permissions",
  "type": 1,
  "default_member_permissions": "0"
}
```

Or this would enable it just for users that have the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission:

```py
permissions = str(1 << 5)

command = {
    "name": "permissions_test",
    "description": "A test of default permissions",
    "type": 1,
    "default_member_permissions": permissions
}
```

And the following would disable a command for a specific channel:

```py
A_SPECIFIC_CHANNEL = "<channel_id>"
url = "https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/<application_id>/guilds/<my_guild_id>/commands/<my_command_id>/permissions"

json = {
    "permissions": [
        {
            "id": A_SPECIFIC_CHANNEL,
            "type": 3,
            "permission": False
        }
    ]
}

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <my_bearer_token>"
}

r = requests.put(url, headers=headers, json=json)
```

## Slash Commands

Slash commands—the `CHAT_INPUT` type—are a type of application command. They're made up of a name, description, and a block of `options`, which you can think of like arguments to a function.
The name and description help users find your command among many others, and the `options` validate user input as they fill out your command.

Slash commands can also have groups and subcommands to further organize commands. More on those later.

<Alert type="warn">

Slash commands can have a maximum of 8000 characters for combined name, description, and value properties for each command, its options (including subcommands and groups), and choices.
When [localization fields](#localization) are present, only the longest localization for each field (including the default value) is counted towards the size limit.

</Alert>

## Subcommands and Subcommand Groups

For those developers looking to make more organized and complex groups of commands, look no further than subcommands and groups.

**Subcommands** organize your commands by **specifying actions within a command or group**.

**Subcommand Groups** organize your **subcommands** by **grouping subcommands by similar action or resource within a command**.

These are not enforced rules. You are free to use subcommands and groups however you'd like; it's just how Discord thinks about them.

<Alert type="danger">

Using subcommands or subcommand groups will make your base command unusable. You can't send the base `/permissions` command as a valid command if you also have `/permissions add | remove` as subcommands or subcommand groups

</Alert>

Discord supports nesting one level deep within a group, meaning your top level command can contain subcommand groups, and those groups can contain subcommands. **That is the only kind of nesting supported.** Here's some visual examples:

```
VALID

  command
  |
  |__ subcommand
  |
  |__ subcommand

  #######

  command
  |
  |__ subcommand-group
      |
      |__ subcommand
  |
  |__ subcommand-group
      |
      |__ subcommand

#######

INVALID

  command
  |
  |__ subcommand-group
      |
      |__ subcommand-group
  |
  |__ subcommand-group
      |
      |__ subcommand-group

  #######

  command
  |
  |__ subcommand
      |
      |__ subcommand-group
  |
  |__ subcommand
      |
      |__ subcommand-group
```

### Example Walkthrough

<Collapsible title="Example Walkthrough" description="View a moderation bot command example" icon="code">

Let's look at an example. Let's imagine you run a moderation bot. You want to make a `/permissions` command that can do the following:

- Get the guild permissions for a user or a role
- Get the permissions for a user or a role on a specific channel
- Change the guild permissions for a user or a role
- Change the permissions for a user or a role on a specific channel

We'll start by defining the top-level information for `/permissions`:

```js
{
    "name": "permissions",
    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",
    "options": []
}
```

Now we have a command named `permissions`. We want this command to be able to affect users and roles. Rather than making two separate commands, we can use subcommand groups. We want to use subcommand groups here because we are grouping commands on a similar resource: `user` or `role`.

```js
{
    "name": "permissions",
    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "user",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user",
            "type": 2 // 2 is type SUB_COMMAND_GROUP
        },
        {
            "name": "role",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a role",
            "type": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

You'll notice that a command like this **will not show up** in the command explorer. That's because groups are effectively "folders" for commands, and we've made two empty folders. So let's continue.

Now that we've effectively made `user` and `role` "folders", we want to be able to either `get` and `edit` permissions. Within the subcommand groups, we can make subcommands for `get` and `edit`:

```js
{
    "name": "permissions",
    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "user",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user",
            "type": 2, // 2 is type SUB_COMMAND_GROUP
            "options": [
                {
                    "name": "get",
                    "description": "Get permissions for a user",
                    "type": 1 // 1 is type SUB_COMMAND
                },
                {
                    "name": "edit",
                    "description": "Edit permissions for a user",
                    "type": 1
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "role",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a role",
            "type": 2,
            "options": [
                {
                    "name": "get",
                    "description": "Get permissions for a role",
                    "type": 1
                },
                {
                    "name": "edit",
                    "description": "Edit permissions for a role",
                    "type": 1
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Now, we need some arguments! If we chose `user`, we need to be able to pick a user; if we chose `role`, we need to be able to pick a role. We also want to be able to pick between guild-level permissions and channel-specific permissions. For that, we can use optional arguments:

```js
{
    "name": "permissions",
    "description": "Get or edit permissions for an user or a role",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "user",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for an user",
            "type": 2, // 2 is type SUB_COMMAND_GROUP
            "options": [
                {
                    "name": "get",
                    "description": "Get permissions for an user",
                    "type": 1, // 1 is type SUB_COMMAND
                    "options": [
                        {
                            "name": "user",
                            "description": "The user to get",
                            "type": 6, // 6 is type USER
                            "required": true
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "channel",
                            "description": "The channel permissions to get. If omitted, the guild permissions will be returned",
                            "type": 7, // 7 is type CHANNEL
                            "required": false
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "name": "edit",
                    "description": "Edit permissions for an user",
                    "type": 1,

                            "description": "The channel permissions to edit. If omitted, the guild permissions will be edited",
                            "type": 7,

                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

And, done! The JSON looks a bit complicated, but what we've ended up with is a single command that can be scoped to multiple actions, and then further scoped to a particular resource, and then even _further_ scope with optional arguments.

## User Commands

User commands are application commands that appear on the context menu (right click or tap) of users. They're a great way to surface quick actions for your app that target users. They don't take any arguments, and will return the user on whom you clicked or tapped in the interaction response.

<Alert type="warn">

A user must have permission to send text messages in the channel they invoke a user command in.

</Alert>

<Alert type="danger">

The `description` field is not allowed when creating user commands. However, to avoid breaking changes to data models, `description` will be an **empty string** (instead of `null`) when fetching commands.

</Alert>

###### Example User Command

{
  "id": "1241360244118917161",

## Entry Point Commands

An Entry Point command serves as the primary way for users to open an application's embedded activity.

For the Entry Point command to be visible to users, an app must have the [`EMBEDDED` flag](/resources/application#application-flags) enabled.

###### Example Entry Point Command

```json
{
  "id": "1277685617043439616",
  "type": 4,
  "application_id": "1006584476094177371",
  "version": "1277685617043439617",
  "name": "launch",
  "description": "Launch Racing with Friends",
  "dm_permission": true,
  "contexts": [0, 1, 2],
  "integration_types": [0, 1],
  "handler": 2
}
```

### Entry Point Handlers

When a user invokes an app's Entry Point command, the value of [`handler`](#application-command-object) will determine how the interaction is handled:

- For `APP_HANDLER`, the application is responsible for [responding to the interaction](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#responding-to-an-interaction). It can respond by launching the app's associated embedded activity using the [`LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` interaction callback type](/interactions/receiving-and-responding##interaction-callback-type), or take another action (like sending a follow-up message in channel).
- For `DISCORD_LAUNCH_ACTIVITY`, Discord will handle the interaction automatically by launching the associated embedded activity and sending a message to the channel where it was launched.
- For `APP_HANDLER_LAUNCH_ACTIVITY`, the application is again responsible for [responding to the interaction](/interactions/receiving-and-responding#responding-to-an-interaction), but it can only respond by launching the app's associated embedded activity using the [`LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` interaction callback type](/interactions/receiving-and-responding##interaction-callback-type).

When embedded activities are enabled on an application, an Entry Point command (named "launch") is automatically created for your app with `DISCORD_LAUNCH_ACTIVITY` set as the [Entry Point handler](#entry-point-handlers).

## Autocomplete

Autocomplete interactions allow your application to dynamically return option suggestions to a user as they type.

An autocomplete interaction **can return partial data** for option values. Your application will receive partial data for any existing user input, as long as that input passes client-side validation.
For example, you may receive partial strings, but not invalid numbers. The option the user is currently typing will be sent with a `focused: true` boolean field and options the user has already filled will also be sent but without the `focused` field.
This is a special case where options that are otherwise required might not be present, due to the user not having filled them yet.

<Alert type="warn">

This validation is **client-side only**.

</Alert>

## Localization

Application commands can be localized, which will cause them to use localized names and descriptions depending on the client's selected language. This is entirely optional.
Localization is available for names and descriptions of commands, subcommands, and options, as well as the names of choices, by submitting the appropriate `name_localizations` and `description_localizations` fields when creating or updating the application command.

Application commands may be partially localized - not all [available locales](/docs/reference#locales) are required, nor do different fields within a command need to support the same set of locales.
If a locale is not present in a localizations dictionary for a field, users in that locale will see the default value for that field. It's not necessary to fill out all locales with the default value. Any localized values that are identical to the default will be ignored.

Localized option names are subject to an additional constraint, which is that they must be distinct from all other default option names of that command, as well as all other option names within that locale on that command.

When taking advantage of command localization, the interaction payload received by your client will still use default command, subcommand, and option names.
To localize your interaction response, you can determine the client's selected language by using the `locale` key in the interaction payload.

An application command furnished with localizations might look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "birthday",
  "type": 1,
  "description": "Wish a friend a happy birthday",
  "name_localizations": {
    "zh-CN": "生日",
    "el": "γενέθλια"
  },
  "description_localizations": {
    "zh-CN": "祝你朋友生日快乐"
  },
  "options": [
    {
      "name": "age",
      "type": 4,
      "description": "Your friend's age",
      "name_localizations": {
        "zh-CN": "岁数"
      },
      "description_localizations": {
        "zh-CN": "你朋友的岁数"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Locale Fallbacks

For application commands, there are built-in fallbacks in case a user's locale isn't present in the localizations. If the fallback locale is also missing, it will use the default.

<Alert type="warn">

You should make sure to include your default value in its proper locale key, otherwise it may use a fallback value unexpectedly.
For example, if your default value is `en-US`, but you don't specify the `en-US` value in your localizations, users with `en-US` selected will see the `en-GB` value if it's specified.
For example, if you have a command with the default name "color", and your localizations specify only the `en-GB` value as "colour", users in the `en-US` locale will see "colour" because the `en-US` key is missing.

</Alert>

| Locale | Fallback |
| ------ | -------- |
| en-US  | en-GB    |
| en-GB  | en-US    |
| es-419 | es-ES    |

### Retrieving Localized Commands

While most endpoints that return application command objects will return the `name_localizations` and `description_localizations` fields, some will not by default. This includes `GET` endpoints that return all of an application's guild or global commands. Instead, those endpoints will supply additional `name_localized` or `description_localized` fields, which only contain the localization relevant to the requester's locale. The full dictionaries can still be obtained by supplying the appropriate query argument.

For example, if a batch `GET` request were made with locale `zh-CN`, including the above command, the returned object would look as follows:

```json
{
  "name": "birthday",
  "type": 1,
  "description": "Wish a friend a happy birthday",
  "name_localized": "生日",
  "description_localized": "祝你朋友生日快乐",
  "options": [
    {
      "name": "age",
      "type": 4,
      "description": "Your friend's age",
      "name_localized": "岁数",
      "description_localized": "你朋友的岁数"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the requester's locale is not found in a localizations dictionary, then the corresponding `name_localization` or `description_localization` for that field will also not be present.

Locale is determined by looking at the `X-Discord-Locale` header, then the `Accept-Language` header if not present, then lastly the user settings locale.

## Age-Restricted Commands

A command that contains age-restricted content should have the [`nsfw` field](#application-command-object) set to `true` upon creation or update. Marking a command as age-restricted will limit who can see and access the command, and from which channels.

### Using Age-Restricted Commands

To use an age-restricted command, a user must be 18 years or older and access the command from either:

- an [age-restricted channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/115000084051-Age-Restricted-Channels-and-Content) or
- a DM with the app _after_ [enabling age-restricted commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10123937946007) within their user settings.

Details about accessing and using age-restricted commands is in [the Help Center](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10123937946007).
