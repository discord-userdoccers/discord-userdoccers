# Application Commands

Application commands are commands that an application can register to Discord. They provide users a first-class way of interacting directly with your application that feels deeply integrated into Discord.

## Application Command Object

<Alert type="info">

`CHAT_INPUT` command names must be all lowercase
matching `^[\w-]{(1, 32)}$`. `USER` and `MESSAGE` commands may be mixed case
and can include spaces.

###### Partial Application Command Option Structure

All options have names, and an option can either be a parameter and input value, in which case `value` will be set, or it can denote a subcommand or group, in which case it will contain a top-level key and another array of `options`.

`value` and `options` are mutually exclusive.

## Application Command Index Object

Multiple different resources are queryable with the application command index structure, including guilds and applications themselves. Sometimes usable with channels.

###### Application Command Index Structure

^1^ This field will sometimes be an empty array when requested via [Get Application Command Index](#get-application-command-index) even if the application has registered global commmands. For more reliability, actual global commands should be obtained via [Get Global Application Commands](#get-global-application-commands).

## Authorizing Your Application

Application commands do not depend on a bot user in the guild; they use the [interactions](/interactions/receiving-and-responding) model. To create commands in a guild, your application must be authorized with the `applications.commands` scope.

<Alert type="note">

Requesting `bot` scope will implicitly include `applications.commands` scope as well.

</Alert>

When requesting this scope, Discord "shortcuts" the OAuth2 flow similar to adding a bot. You don't need to complete the flow, exchange for a token, or any of that.

If your application does not require a bot user within the guild for its commands to work, **you no longer need to add for the bot scope or specific permissions**.

## Registering a Command

<Alert type="info">

Commands can only be registered via HTTP endpoint.

</Alert>

Commands can be scoped either globally or to a specific guild. Global commands are available for every guild that adds your app. An individual app's global commands are also available in DMs if that app has a bot that shares a mutual guild with the user.

Guild commands are specific to the guild you specify when making them. Guild commands are not available in DMs. Command names are unique per application, per type, within each scope (global and guild). That means:

- Your app **cannot** have two global `CHAT_INPUT` commands with the same name
- Your app **cannot** have two guild `CHAT_INPUT` commands within the same name **on the same guild**
- Your app **cannot** have two global `USER` commands with the same name
- Your app **can** have a global and guild `CHAT_INPUT` command with the same name
- Your app **can** have a global `CHAT_INPUT` and `USER` command with the same name
- Multiple apps **can** have commands with the same names

This list is non-exhaustive. In general, remember that command names must be unique per application, per type, and within each scope (global and guild).

An app can have the following number of commands:

- 100 global `CHAT_INPUT` commands
- 5 global `USER` commands
- 5 global `MESSAGE` commands

As well as the same amount of guild-specific commands per guild.

<Alert type="danger">

There is a global rate limit of 200 application command creates per day, per guild.

</Alert>

### Making a Global Command

Global commands are available on _all_ your app's guilds.

Global commands have inherent read-repair functionality. That means that if you make an update to a global command, and an user tries to use that command before it has updated for them, Discord will do an internal version check and reject the command, and trigger a reload for that command.

To make a **global** command, make an HTTP POST call like this:

```py
import requests


url = "https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/<my_application_id>/commands"

# This is an example CHAT_INPUT or Slash Command, with a type of 1
json = {
    "name": "blep",
    "type": 1,
    "description": "Send a random adorable animal photo",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "animal",
            "description": "The type of animal",
            "type": 3,
            "required": True,
            "choices": [
                {
                    "name": "Dog",
                    "value": "animal_dog"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Cat",
                    "value": "animal_cat"
                },
                {
                    "name": "Penguin",
                    "value": "animal_penguin"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "only_smol",
            "description": "Whether to show only baby animals",
            "type": 5,
            "required": False
        }
    ]
}

# For authorization, you can use either your bot token
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bot <my_bot_token>"
}

# or a client credentials token for your app with the applications.commands.update scope
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <my_credentials_token>"
}

r = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json)
```

### Making a Guild Command

Guild commands are available only within the guild specified on creation. Guild commands update **instantly**. Discord recommends you use guild commands for quick testing, and global commands when they're ready for public use.

To make a **guild** command, make a similar HTTP POST call, but scope it to a specific `guild_id`:

```py
import requests


url = "https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/<my_application_id>/guilds/<guild_id>/commands"

# This is an example USER command, with a type of 2
json = {
    "name": "High Five",
    "type": 2
}

# For authorization, you can use either your bot token
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bot <my_bot_token>"
}

# or a client credentials token for your app with the applications.commands.update scope
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <my_credentials_token>"
}

r = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json)
```

## Updating and Deleting a Command

Commands can be deleted and updated by making `DELETE` and `PATCH` calls to the command endpoint. Those endpoints are

- `/applications/{application.id}/commands/{command.id}` for global commands, or
- `/applications/{application.id}/guilds/{guild.id}/commands/{command.id}` for guild commands

Because commands have unique names within a type and scope, Discord treats `POST` requests for new commands as upserts. That means **making a new command with an already-used name for your application will update the existing command**.

Full documentation of endpoints can be found [here](#endpoints).

| permission | boolean   | Whether the command is allowed to be called by the entity                                        |

###### Application Command Permission Type

| Value | Name |
| ----- | ---- |
| 1     | ROLE |
| 2     | USER |

Need to keep some of your commands safe from prying eyes, or only available to the right people? Commands support permission overwrites! For both guild _and_ global commands of all types, you can enable or disable a specific user or role in a guild from using a command.

<Alert type="info">

For now, if you don't have permission to use a command, they'll show up in the command picker as disabled and unusable. They will **not** be hidden.

</Alert>

You can also set a `default_permission` on your commands if you want them to be disabled by default when your app is added to a new guild. Setting `default_permission` to `false` will disallow _anyone_ in a guild from using the command—even Administrators and guild owners—unless a specific overwrite is configured. It will also disable the command from being usable in DMs.

For example, this command will not be usable by anyone in any guilds by default:

```json
{
  "name": "permissions_test",
  "description": "A test of default permissions",
  "type": 1,
  "default_permission": false
}
```

To enable it just for a moderator role:

```py
MODERATOR_ROLE_ID = "<moderator_role_id>"
url = "https://discord.com/api/v10/applications/<my_application_id>/guilds/<my_guild_id>/commands/<my_command_id>/permissions"

json = {
    "permissions": [
        {
            "id": MODERATOR_ROLE_ID,
            "type": 1,
            "permission": True
        }
    ]
}

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bot <my_bot_token>"
}

r = requests.put(url, headers=headers, json=json)
```

## Slash Commands

Slash commands—the `CHAT_INPUT` type—are a type of application command. They're made up of a name, description, and a block of `options`, which you can think of like arguments to a function. The name and description help users find your command among many others, and the `options` validate user input as they fill out your command.

Slash commands can also have groups and subcommands to further organize commands. More on those later.

<Alert type="warn">

Slash commands can have a maximum of 4000 characters for combined name, description, and value properties for each command and its subcommands and groups

</Alert>

###### Example Slash Command

```json
{
  "name": "blep",
  "type": 1,
  "description": "Send a random adorable animal photo",
  "options": [
    {
      "name": "animal",
      "description": "The type of animal",
      "type": 3,
      "required": true,
      "choices": [
        {
          "name": "Dog",
          "value": "animal_dog"
        },
        {
          "name": "Cat",
          "value": "animal_cat"
        },
        {
          "name": "Penguin",
          "value": "animal_penguin"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "only_smol",
      "description": "Whether to show only baby animals",
      "type": 5,
      "required": false
    }
  ]
}
```

When someone uses a slash command, your application will receive an interaction:

## Subcommands and Subcommand Groups

<Alert type="warn">

Currently, subcommands and subcommand groups all appear at the top level in the command explorer. This may change in the future to include them as nested autocomplete options.

</Alert>

For those developers looking to make more organized and complex groups of commands, look no further than subcommands and groups.

**Subcommands** organize your commands by **specifying actions within a command or group**.

**Subcommand Groups** organize your **subcommands** by **grouping subcommands by similar action or resource within a command**.

These are not enforced rules. You are free to use subcommands and groups however you'd like; it's just how we think about them.

<Alert type="danger">

Using subcommands or subcommand groups will make your base command unusable. You can't send the base `/permissions` command as a valid command if you also have `/permissions add | remove` as subcommands or subcommand groups

</Alert>

Discord supports nesting one level deep within a group, meaning your top level command can contain subcommand groups, and those groups can contain subcommands. **That is the only kind of nesting supported.** Here's some visual examples:

```
VALID

  command
  |
  |__ subcommand
  |
  |__ subcommand

  command
  |
  |__ subcommand-group
      |

```

### Example Walkthrough

Let's look at an example. Let's imagine you run a moderation bot. You want to make a `/permissions` command that can do the following:

- Get the guild permissions for a user or a role
- Get the permissions for a user or a role on a specific channel
- Change the guild permissions for a user or a role
- Change the permissions for a user or a role on a specific channel

We'll start by defining the top-level information for `/permissions`:

```js
{
    "name": "permissions",
    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",
    "options": []
}
```

Now we have a command named `permissions`. We want this command to be able to affect users and roles. Rather than making two separate commands, we can use subcommand groups. We want to use subcommand groups here because we are grouping commands on a similar resource: `user` or `role`.

```js
{
    "name": "permissions",
    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "user",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user",
            "type": 2 // 2 is type SUB_COMMAND_GROUP
        },
        {
            "name": "role",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a role",
            "type": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

You'll notice that a command like this **will not show up** in the command explorer. That's because groups are effectively "folders" for commands, and we've made two empty folders. So let's continue.

Now that we've effectively made `user` and `role` "folders", we want to be able to either `get` and `edit` permissions. Within the subcommand groups, we can make subcommands for `get` and `edit`:

```js
{
    "name": "permissions",
    "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user or a role",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "user",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a user",
            "type": 2, // 2 is type SUB_COMMAND_GROUP
            "options": [
                {
                    "name": "get",
                    "description": "Get permissions for a user",
                    "type": 1 // 1 is type SUB_COMMAND
                },
                {
                    "name": "edit",
                    "description": "Edit permissions for a user",
                    "type": 1
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "role",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a role",
            "type": 2,
            "options": [
                {
                    "name": "get",
                    "description": "Get permissions for a role",
                    "type": 1
                },
                {
                    "name": "edit",
                    "description": "Edit permissions for a role",
                    "type": 1
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Now, we need some arguments! If we chose `user`, we need to be able to pick a user; if we chose `role`, we need to be able to pick a role. We also want to be able to pick between guild-level permissions and channel-specific permissions. For that, we can use optional arguments:

```js
{
    "name": "permissions",
    "description": "Get or edit permissions for an user or a role",
    "options": [
        {
            "name": "user",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for an user",
            "type": 2, // 2 is type SUB_COMMAND_GROUP
            "options": [
                {
                    "name": "get",
                    "description": "Get permissions for an user",
                    "type": 1, // 1 is type SUB_COMMAND
                    "options": [
                        {
                            "name": "user",
                            "description": "The user to get",
                            "type": 6, // 6 is type USER
                            "required": true
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "channel",
                            "description": "The channel permissions to get. If omitted, the guild permissions will be returned",
                            "type": 7, // 7 is type CHANNEL
                            "required": false
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "name": "edit",
                    "description": "Edit permissions for an user",
                    "type": 1,
                    "options": [
                        {
                            "name": "user",
                            "description": "The user to edit",
                            "type": 6,
                            "required": true
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "channel",
                            "description": "The channel permissions to edit. If omitted, the guild permissions will be edited",
                            "type": 7,
                            "required": false
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "role",
            "description": "Get or edit permissions for a role",
            "type": 2,
            "options": [
                {

                            "name": "role",
                            "description": "The role to get",
                            "type": 8, // 8 is type ROLE
                            "required": true
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "channel",
                            "description": "The channel permissions to get. If omitted, the guild permissions will be returned",
                            "type": 7,
                            "required": false
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "name": "edit",
                    "description": "Edit permissions for a role",
                    "type": 1,
                    "options": [
                        {
                            "name": "role",
                            "description": "The role to edit",
                            "type": 8,
                            "required": true
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "channel",
                            "description": "The channel permissions to edit. If omitted, the guild permissions will be edited",
                            "type": 7,
                            "required": false
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

And, done! The JSON looks a bit complicated, but what we've ended up with is a single command that can be scoped to multiple actions, and then further scoped to a particular resource, and then even _further_ scope with optional arguments.

## User Commands

User commands are application commands that appear on the context menu (right click or tap) of users. They're a great way to surface quick actions for your app that target users. They don't take any arguments, and will return the user on whom you clicked or tapped in the interaction response.

<Alert type="danger">

The `description` field is not allowed when creating user commands. However, to avoid breaking changes to data models, `description` will be an **empty string** (instead of `null`) when fetching commands.

</Alert>

###### Example User Command

```json
{
  "name": "High Five",
  "type": 2
}
```

When someone uses a user command, your application will receive an interaction:
