# Account Revert

Account Revert / Recovery is a feature intended for post-takeover recovery, after a scammer has already changed either the victim's email, password, phone number or 2FA settings.

Upon an email change, Discord will send out an email to the victim's email about the change and give them the option to start the account recovery process alongside generating a temporary token for it, which is valid for 48 hours.

Upon completion, the current phone number is removed from the account and all phone numbers previously associated with the account are blacklisted. This could be to prevent a followup takeover via [sim-jacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam).

<Alert type="warn">

If the account **must** have a phone number (aka, a phone-locked account), then it'll still be locked as it needs a new phone number.

This process will fail if the account was somehow deleted beforehand (by anti-spam or Discord staff), or if the original email was somehow assigned to a different account.

</Alert>

This initiates the revert process, in which Discord will:

- Invalidate the revert token used
- Invalidate all authorization tokens and active gateway sessions associated with the account
- Set the account's email back to the original
- Set the account's password to the one provided
- Remove 2FA and phone number from the account
- Blacklist all phone numbers previously associated with the account
