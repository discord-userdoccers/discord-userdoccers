###### Example Thread Channel

[Threads](/topics/threads) can be either `archived` or `active`. Archived threads are generally immutable. To send a message or add a reaction, a thread must first be unarchived. The API will helpfully automatically unarchive a thread when sending a message in that thread.

Unlike with channels, the API will only sync updates to users about threads the current user can view. When receiving a [Guild Create](/topics/gateway-events#guild-create) payload, the API will only include active threads the current user can view. Threads inside of private channels are completely private to the members of that private channel. As such, when _gaining_ access to a channel in a subscribed guild the API sends a [Thread List Sync](/topics/gateway-events#thread-list-sync), which includes all active threads in that channel.

Threads also track membership. Users must be added to a thread before sending messages in them. The API will helpfully automatically add users to a thread when sending a message in that thread.

Guilds have limits on the number of active threads and members per thread. Once these are reached additional threads cannot be created or unarchived, and users cannot be added. Threads do not count against the per-guild channel limit.

The [threads](/topics/threads) topic has some more information.

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/users/@me/channels">
  Get Private Channels

  Get Channel
</RouteHeader>

Returns a [channel](#channel-object) object for a given channel ID. If the channel is a thread, a [thread member](#thread-member-object) object is included in the returned result.

<RouteHeader method="PATCH" url="/channels/{channel.id}" supportsAuditReason>
  Modify Channel
</RouteHeader>

Updates a channel's settings. Returns a [channel](#channel-object) on success. Fires a [Channel Update](/topics/gateway-events#channel-update) or [Thread Update](/topics/gateway-events#channel-update) Gateway event.

<Alert type="info">

All parameters to this endpoint are optional.

###### JSON Params

If modifying a guild channel, requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild. If modifying permission overwrites, the `MANAGE_ROLES` permission is required. Only permissions you have in the guild or parent channel (if applicable) can be allowed/denied (unless you have a `MANAGE_ROLES` overwrite in the channel). Fires a [Channel Update](/topics/gateway-events#channel-update) Gateway event. If modifying a category, individual [Channel Update](/topics/gateway-events#channel-update) events will fire for each child channel that also changes.

If modifying a thread and setting `archived` to `false`, when `locked` is also `false`, only the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission is required. Otherwise, requires the `MANAGE_THREADS` permission. Requires the thread to have `archived` set to `false` or be set to `false` in the request. Fires a [Thread Update](/topics/gateway-events#thread-update) Gateway event.

<RouteHeader method="DELETE" url="/channels/{channel.id}" supportsAuditReason>
  Delete Channel
</RouteHeader>

Deletes a channel, or closes a private message. Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild, or `MANAGE_THREADS` if the channel is a thread. Deleting a category does not delete its child channels; they will have their `parent_id` removed and a [Channel Update](/topics/gateway-events#channel-update) Gateway event will fire for each of them. Returns a [channel](#channel-object) object on success. Fires a [Channel Delete](/topics/gateway-events#channel-delete) or [Thread Delete](/topics/gateway-events#thread-delete) Gateway event.

<Alert type="warn">

Deleting a guild channel cannot be undone. Use this with caution, as it is impossible to undo this action when performed on a guild channel. In contrast, when used with a private message, it is possible to undo the action by opening a private message with the recipient again.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

For Community guilds, the Rules or Guidelines channel and the Community Updates channel cannot be deleted.

  Create Thread from Message
</RouteHeader>

Creates a new thread from an existing message. Returns a [channel](#channel-object) on success. Fires a [Thread Create](/topics/gateway-events#thread-create) and a [Message Update](/topics/gateway-events#message-update) Gateway event.

When called on a `GUILD_TEXT` channel, creates a `PUBLIC_THREAD`. When called on a `GUILD_NEWS` channel, creates a `NEWS_THREAD`.

<Alert type="info">

The ID of the created thread will be the same as the ID of the message, and as such a message can only have a single thread created from it.

  Create Thread
</RouteHeader>

Creates a new thread that is not connected to an existing message. Returns a [channel](#channel-object) (with an optional extra [`message`](/resources/message#message-object) key containing the starter message) on success. Fires a [Thread Create](#channel-object) Gateway event.

In thread-only channels:

- The type of the created thread is `PUBLIC_THREAD`.
- See [message formatting](/reference#message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.
- The current user must have the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission (`CREATE_PUBLIC_THREADS` is ignored).
- The maximum request size when sending a message is **100 MiB**.
- For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.
