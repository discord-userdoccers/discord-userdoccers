###### Example Thread Channel

[Threads](/topics/threads) can be either `archived` or `active`. Archived threads are generally immutable. To send a message or add a reaction, a thread must first be unarchived. The API will helpfully automatically unarchive a thread when sending a message in that thread.

Unlike with channels, the API will only sync updates to users about threads the current user can view. When receiving a [guild create](/topics/gateway#guild-create) payload, the API will only include active threads the current user can view. Threads inside of private channels are completely private to the members of that private channel. As such, when _gaining_ access to a channel the API sends a [thread list sync](/topics/gateway#thread-list-sync), which includes all active threads in that channel.

Threads also track membership. Users must be added to a thread before sending messages in them. The API will helpfully automatically add users to a thread when sending a message in that thread.

Guilds have limits on the number of active threads and members per thread. Once these are reached additional threads cannot be created or unarchived, and users cannot be added. Threads do not count against the per-guild channel limit.

The [threads](/topics/threads) topic has some more information.

### Overwrite Object

See [permissions](/topics/permissions#permissions) for more information about the `allow` and `deny` fields.

###### Overwrite Structure

| Field | Type      | Description                   |
| ----- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| id    | snowflake | role or user id               |
| type  | int       | either 0 (role) or 1 (member) |
| allow | string    | permission bit set            |
| deny  | string    | permission bit set            |

### Thread Metadata Object

The thread metadata object contains a number of thread-specific channel fields that are not needed by other channel types.

###### Thread Metadata Structure

| Field                 | Type              | Description                                                                                                         |

| auto_archive_duration | integer           | duration in minutes to automatically archive the thread after recent activity, can be set to: 60, 1440, 4320, 10080 |
| archive_timestamp     | ISO8601 timestamp | timestamp when the thread's archive status was last changed, used for calculating recent activity                   |
| locked                | boolean           | whether the thread is locked; when a thread is locked, only users with MANAGE_THREADS can unarchive it              |
| invitable?            | boolean           | whether non-moderators can add other non-moderators to a thread; only available on private threads                  |

### Thread Member Object

A thread member is used to indicate whether a user has joined a thread or not.

###### Thread Member Structure

| Field          | Type              | Description                                                     |

| flags          | integer           | any user-thread settings, currently only used for notifications |

** \* These fields are ommitted on the member sent within each thread in the [GUILD_CREATE](/topics/gateway#guild-create) event **

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}">
  Get Channel
</RouteHeader>

Get a channel by ID. Returns a [channel](#channel-object) object. If the channel is a thread, a [thread member](/resources/channel#thread-member-object) object is included in the returned result.

<RouteHeader
  method="PATCH"
  url="/channels/{channel.id}"
  supportsXAuditLogHeader
>
  Modify Channel
</RouteHeader>

Update a channel's settings. Returns a [channel](#channel-object) on success, and a 400 BAD REQUEST on invalid parameters. All JSON parameters are optional.

###### JSON Params (Group DM)

Fires a [Channel Update](/topics/gateway#channel-update) Gateway event.

| Field | Type   | Description                  |
| ----- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| name  | string | 1-100 character channel name |
| icon  | binary | base64 encoded icon          |

###### JSON Params (Guild channel)

Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild. Fires a [Channel Update](/topics/gateway#channel-update) Gateway event. If modifying a category, individual [Channel Update](/topics/gateway#channel-update) events will fire for each child channel that also changes. If modifying permission overwrites, the `MANAGE_ROLES` permission is required. Only permissions your bot has in the guild or channel can be allowed/denied (unless your bot has a `MANAGE_ROLES` overwrite in the channel).

###### JSON Params (Thread)

When setting `archived` to `false`, when `locked` is also `false`, only the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission is required.

Otherwise, requires the `MANAGE_THREADS` permission. Fires a [Thread Update](/topics/gateway#thread-update) Gateway event. Requires the thread to have `archived` set to `false` or be set to `false` in the request.

<RouteHeader
  method="DELETE"
  url="/channels/{channel.id}"
  supportsXAuditLogHeader
>
  Delete/Close Channel
</RouteHeader>

Delete a channel, or close a private message. Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild, or `MANAGE_THREADS` if the channel is a thread. Deleting a category does not delete its child channels; they will have their `parent_id` removed and a [Channel Update](/topics/gateway#channel-update) Gateway event will fire for each of them. Returns a [channel](#channel-object) object on success. Fires a [Channel Delete](/topics/gateway#channel-delete) Gateway event (or [Thread Delete](/topics/gateway#thread-delete) if the channel was a thread).

<Alert type="warn">

Deleting a guild channel cannot be undone. Use this with caution, as it is impossible to undo this action when performed on a guild channel. In contrast, when used with a private message, it is possible to undo the action by opening a private message with the recipient again.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

For Community guilds, the Rules or Guidelines channel and the Community Updates channel cannot be deleted.

</Alert>

<RouteHeader
  method="PUT"
  url="/channels/{channel.id}/permissions/{overwrite.id}"

  Edit Channel Permissions
</RouteHeader>

Edit the channel permission overwrites for a user or role in a channel. Only usable for guild channels. Requires the `MANAGE_ROLES` permission. Only permissions your bot has in the guild or channel can be allowed/denied (unless your bot has a `MANAGE_ROLES` overwrite in the channel). Returns a 204 empty response on success. For more information about permissions, see [permissions](/topics/permissions#permissions).

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}/invites">
  Get Channel Invites
</RouteHeader>

Returns a list of [invite](/resources/invite#invite-object) objects (with [invite metadata](/resources/invite#invite-metadata-object)) for the channel. Only usable for guild channels. Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission.

<RouteHeader
  method="POST"
  url="/channels/{channel.id}/invites"
  supportsXAuditLogHeader
>
  Create Channel Invite
</RouteHeader>

Create a new [invite](/resources/invite#invite-object) object for the channel. Only usable for guild channels. Requires the `CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE` permission. All JSON parameters for this route are optional, however the request body is not. If you are not sending any fields, you still have to send an empty JSON object (`{}`). Returns an [invite](/resources/invite#invite-object) object. Fires an [Invite Create](/topics/gateway#invite-create) Gateway event.
