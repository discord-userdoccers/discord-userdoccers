###### Example Thread Channel

[Threads](/topics/threads) can be either `archived` or `active`. Archived threads are generally immutable. To send a message or add a reaction, a thread must first be unarchived. The API will helpfully automatically unarchive a thread when sending a message in that thread.

Unlike with channels, the API will only sync updates to users about threads the current user can view. When receiving a [Guild Create](/topics/gateway-events#guild-create) payload, the API will only include active threads the current user can view. Threads inside of private channels are completely private to the members of that private channel. As such, when _gaining_ access to a channel in a subscribed guild the API sends a [Thread List Sync](/topics/gateway-events#thread-list-sync), which includes all active threads in that channel.

Threads also track membership. Users must be added to a thread before sending messages in them. The API will helpfully automatically add users to a thread when sending a message in that thread.

Guilds have limits on the number of active threads and members per thread. Once these are reached additional threads cannot be created or unarchived, and users cannot be added. Threads do not count against the per-guild channel limit.

The [threads](/topics/threads) topic has some more information.

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/users/@me/channels">
  Get Private Channels
</RouteHeader>

Returns a list of active [private channel](#channel-object) objects the user is participating in.

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/users/@me/dms/{user.id}" supportsOAuth2="dm_channels.read">
  Get DM Channel
</RouteHeader>

Returns an existing [DM channel](#channel-object) object with a user.

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/users/@me/channels" supportsOAuth2="gdm.join">
  Create Private Channel
</RouteHeader>

One recipient creates or returns an existing [DM channel](#channel-object), none or multiple recipients create a [group DM channel](#channel-object). Returns a [private channel](#channel-object) object. Fires a [Channel Create](/topics/gateway-events#channel-create) Gateway event.

If multiple channels with a single recipient exist, the most recent channel is returned.

<Alert type="warn">

Clients should not use this endpoint to create multiple new DMs in a short period of time. A DM is only counted as created if the user sends the first message in the DM and the channel did not have existing message history. Users may only create 10 new DMs to non-bot users in a 10-minute window.
Suspicious DM activity may be flagged by Discord and require [additional verification steps](/resources/user#required-action-type) or lead to immediate account termination.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

One of `recipient_id`, `recipients` or `access_tokens` is required. Bots cannot DM other bots or create group DMs without `access_tokens`.

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/guilds/{guild.id}/channels" supportsAuditReason>
  Create Guild Channel

Fires a [Channel Create](/topics/gateway-events#channel-create) Gateway event.

<Collapsible title="Bitrate Limits" description="How is the maximum bitrate calculated?" icon="list">

For stage channels, the maximum bitrate is always **64 kbps**.
For voice channels, the limit depends on the guild's [premium tier](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352) and [features](/resources/guild#guild-features).

These limits are summarized in the following table by [premium tier](/resources/guild#premium-tier). Note that if the guild has the [`VIP_REGIONS` feature](/resources/guild#guild-features), the applied limit is always the tier 3 one (**384 kbps**).

| Premium Tier | Bitrate Limit |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| `NONE`       | **96 kbps**   |
| `TIER_1`     | **128 kbps**  |

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}">
  Get Channel
</RouteHeader>

Returns a [channel](#channel-object) object for a given channel ID. Requires the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission for the guild. If the channel is a thread, a [thread member](#thread-member-object) object is included in the returned result.

<RouteHeader method="PATCH" url="/channels/{channel.id}" supportsAuditReason>
  Modify Channel
</RouteHeader>

Updates a channel's settings. Returns a [channel](#channel-object) on success. Fires a [Channel Update](/topics/gateway-events#channel-update) or [Thread Update](/topics/gateway-events#channel-update) Gateway event.

###### JSON Params

If modifying a guild channel, requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild. If modifying permission overwrites, the `MANAGE_ROLES` permission is required. Only permissions you have in the guild or parent channel (if applicable) can be allowed/denied (unless you have a `MANAGE_ROLES` overwrite in the channel). Fires a [Channel Update](/topics/gateway-events#channel-update) Gateway event. If modifying a category, individual [Channel Update](/topics/gateway-events#channel-update) events will fire for each child channel that also changes.

If modifying a thread and setting `archived` to `false`, when `locked` is also `false`, only the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission is required. Otherwise, requires the `MANAGE_THREADS` permission. Requires the thread to have `archived` set to `false` or be set to `false` in the request. Fires a [Thread Update](/topics/gateway-events#thread-update) Gateway event.

<RouteHeader method="DELETE" url="/channels/{channel.id}" supportsAuditReason>
  Delete Channel
</RouteHeader>

Deletes a channel, or closes a private message. Requires the `MANAGE_CHANNELS` permission for the guild, or `MANAGE_THREADS` if the channel is a thread. Deleting a category does not delete its child channels; they will have their `parent_id` removed and a [Channel Update](/topics/gateway-events#channel-update) Gateway event will fire for each of them. Returns a [channel](#channel-object) object on success. Fires a [Channel Delete](/topics/gateway-events#channel-delete) or [Thread Delete](/topics/gateway-events#thread-delete) Gateway event.

<Alert type="warn">

Deleting a guild channel cannot be undone. Use this with caution, as it is impossible to undo this action when performed on a guild channel. In contrast, when used with a private message, it is possible to undo the action by opening a private message with the recipient again.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

For Community guilds, the Rules or Guidelines channel and the Community Updates channel cannot be deleted.
