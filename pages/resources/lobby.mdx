# Lobbies

Lobbies are groups of users that can communicate with each other via text and voice. Users can be in multiple lobbies at once. A lobby can also have metadata (an arbitrary JSON blob) associated with the lobby and each user.

Lobbies have a text chat channel that all members can use to communicate. Messages are sent to all members of the lobby.
Lobbies support also voice calls. Although a lobby is allowed to have 1,000 members, you should not start voice calls in lobbies that large (around 25 is a good number).

### Lobby Object
