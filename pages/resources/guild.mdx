### Membership Screening Object

In guilds with [membership screening](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882) enabled, when a member joins, [Guild Member Add](/topics/gateway-events#guild-member-add) will be emitted but they will initially be restricted from doing any actions in the guild, and `pending` will be true in the [member object](#guild-member-object). When the member completes the screening, [Guild Member Update](/topics/gateway-events#guild-member-update) will be emitted and `pending` will be false.

Giving the member a role will bypass membership screening as well as the guild's verification level, giving the member immediate access to chat. Therefore, instead of giving a role when the member joins, it is recommended to not give the role until the user is no longer `pending`.

<Alert type="warn">

Discord is making significant changes to the membership screening API specifically related to getting and editing the membership screening object. Long story short is that it can be improved. As such, we have removed this documentation. There will **not be** any changes to how pending members work, as outlined above. That behavior will stay the same.

</Alert>

### Onboarding Object

Represents the [onboarding](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/11074987197975-Community-Onboarding-FAQ) flow for a guild.

<Alert type="info">

Onboarding enforces constraints when enabled. These constraints are that there must be at least 7 default channels and at least 5 of them must allow sending messages to the default (@everyone) role. The `mode` field modifies what is considered when enforcing these constraints.

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/users/@me/guilds" supportsOAuth2="guilds">
  Get User Guilds

Returns a list of [user guild](#user-guild-object) objects representing the guilds the current user is a member of.

<Alert type="info">

This endpoint returns 200 guilds by default, which is the maximum number of guilds a non-bot user can join. Therefore, pagination is **not needed** in order to get a list of the users' guilds, and all parameters are optional.

^1^ The first member of the array is used to change properties of the guild's default (@everyone) role. If you are trying to bootstrap a guild with additional roles, keep this in mind. Additionally, the required `id` field within each role object is an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to [overwrite](/resources/channel#permission-overwrite-object) a role's permissions in a channel when also passing in channels with the channels array.

^2^ When specified, none of the default channels are created, and the `position` field is always ignored. Additionally, the `id` field within each channel object may be set to an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to create `GUILD_CATEGORY` channels by setting the `parent_id` field on any children to the category's `id` field. Category channels must be listed before any children.

###### Example Partial Channel Object

  "name": "my-category",

Returns the joined [guild member](#guild-member-object) object or a 204 empty response (if the user is already a member of the guild) on success. May fire a [Guild Member Add](/topics/gateway-events#guild-member-add) Gateway event.

For guilds with [membership screening](#membership-screening-object) enabled, this endpoint will default to adding new members as `pending` in the [guild member](#guild-member-object) object. Members that are `pending` will have to complete membership screening before they become full members that can talk.

<Alert type="info">

This endpoint is not usable by user accounts. The Authorization header must be a bot token (belonging to the same application used for authorization), and the bot must be a member of the guild with the `CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE` permission.

^1^ For guilds with membership screening enabled, assigning a role using the `roles` parameter will add the user to the guild as a full member (`pending` is false in the [member object](#guild-member-object)). A member with a role will bypass membership screening and the guild's verification level, and get immediate access to chat. Therefore, instead of assigning a role when the member joins, it is recommended to grant roles only after the user completes screening.

^1^ Requires the member to be connected to voice. When moving members to channels, the current user _must_ have permissions to both connect to the channel and have the `MOVE_MEMBERS` permission. If the `channel_id` is set to `null`, this will force the target user to be disconnected from voice.

^2^ Guild administrators cannot be timed out. If a member is timed out and becomes an administrator before their timeout expires, the timeout will no longer have an effect.
