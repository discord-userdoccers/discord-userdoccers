### Role Object

Roles represent a set of permissions attached to a group of users. Roles have names, colors, and can be "pinned" to the side bar, causing their members to be listed separately. Roles can have separate permission profiles for the global context (guild) and channel context. The @everyone role has the same ID as the guild it belongs to.

<Alert type="info">

Roles without colors (`color` of 0) do not count towards the final computed color in the user list.

### Role Connection Configuration Object

Holds configuration for a role's linking requirements.

###### Role Connection Configuration Structure

This structure is represented as an array[array[[role connection requirement](#role-connection-requirement-structure) object]].

The top-level array represents requirements using OR logic, while the inner arrays represent requirements using AND logic.
This means that a user must satisfy at least one requirement from the top-level array, but all requirements within that array to be considered eligible for the role.

^1^ Allows a member who does not meet verification requirements to participate in the guild, and forces the [member's `pending` status](#guild-member-object) to be `false`. Removing this flag does not make the member pending again.

^2^ Quarantined users, similar to timed out users, are prevented from interacting with the guild in any way.

### Member Verification Object

In guilds with [member verification](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882) enabled, when a member joins,
a [Guild Member Add](/topics/gateway-events#guild-member-add) Gateway event will be dispatched but they will initially be restricted from doing any actions in the guild, and `pending` will be true in the [guild member](#guild-member-object) object.
When the member completes the verification, a [Guild Member Update](/topics/gateway-events#guild-member-update) Gateway event will be dispatched and `pending` will be false.

To represent a member's progress towards becoming a full member of the guild, a [Guild Join Request Create](/topics/gateway-events#guild-join-request-create) Gateway event will be dispatched.
Once the join request is approved, the member's `pending` status will be false and they will be able to interact with the guild.
Unless using [manual approval](#manual-approval), the join request will be automatically approved when the user [submits their join request](#create-guild-join-request).

Assigning a member the [`BYPASSES_VERIFICATION` flag](#guild-member-flags) will force their `pending` status to be false and approve their current join request regardless of the join request's status.
Note that bot users will always bypass member verification and have their `pending` status set to false.

#### Guild Previewing

Discoverable guilds, guilds with member verification enabled, and guilds in a directory entry have the [`PREVIEW_ENABLED`](#guild-features) feature by default.
This allows the guild to be lurkable by users who are not members, if discoverable, and allows members who have not passed the verification gate to view the guild without interacting with it.

If a guild has member verification enabled and is not previewable, new joiners will not be able to view the guild until they pass the verification gate, and are therefore not considered members until they do. **This means members do not join the guild until they pass the verification gate.**
A [Guild Member Add](/topics/gateway-events#guild-member-add) Gateway event will not be dispatched until the member has passed the verification gate, and `pending` will always be false in the [guild member](#guild-member-object) object for new joiners.
Join requests will continue to be dispatched as normal, but there will not be an associated guild member until the join request is approved.

From the joiner's perspective, they will also not receive a [Guild Create](/topics/gateway-events#guild-create) Gateway event or any other events dispatched from the guild until they pass member verification.
Non-previewable pending guilds can only be retrieved with the [Get Join Request Guilds](#get-join-request-guilds) endpoint. Their join requests are also sent in the [`guild_join_requests` field of the Ready event](/topics/gateway-events#ready).

#### Manual Approval

To use [form field types](#member-verification-form-field-type) other than `TERMS`, the guild must have the [`MEMBER_VERIFICATION_MANUAL_APPROVAL` guild feature](#guild-features) enabled.
When using these form field types, join requests must be [manually approved](#action-guild-join-request) after they are [submitted](#create-guild-join-request) before the user can complete member verification.

When only using only [`TERMS` form field types](#member-verification-form-field-type), the join request will be automatically approved when the user [submits the request](#create-guild-join-request).

### Guild Join Request Object

Guild join requests are an extension of [member verification](#member-verification-object) that represent a user's request to join a guild.
A join request is created when a user attempts to join a guild with member verification enabled, and the user must complete the verification process to join the guild.
All join requests are stored for 180 days.

Most join request features require the [`MEMBER_VERIFICATION_MANUAL_APPROVAL` guild feature](#guild-features), as join request are automatically actioned when only using the `TERMS` [form field type](#member-verification-form-field-type) and do not require manual approval.
This includes most of the join request endpoints, such as [Get Guild Join Request](#get-guild-join-request) and [Action Guild Join Request](#action-guild-join-request).

<Alert type="info">

Guild join requests are not returned to moderators until they are submitted by the user.

### Onboarding Object

The [onboarding](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/11074987197975-Community-Onboarding-FAQ) flow for a guild.

<Alert type="info">

Onboarding enforces constraints when enabled. These constraints are that there must be at least 7 default channels and at least 5 of them must allow sending messages to the default (@everyone) role. The `mode` field modifies what is considered when enforcing these constraints.

^1^ The first member of the array is used to change properties of the guild's default (@everyone) role. If you are trying to bootstrap a guild with additional roles, keep this in mind. Additionally, the required `id` field within each role object is an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to [overwrite](/resources/channel#permission-overwrite-object) a role's permissions in a channel when also passing in channels with the channels array.

^2^ The `id` field within each channel object may be set to an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to create `GUILD_CATEGORY` channels by setting the `parent_id` field on any children to the category's `id` field. Category channels must be listed before any children.

^3^ Adds the [`INTERNAL_EMPLOYEE_ONLY` guild feature](#guild-features), making the server only available for Discord employees. Only settable by Discord employees.

  Search Guild Members
</RouteHeader>

Returns [supplemental guild member](#supplemental-guild-member-object) objects containing [guild member](#guild-member-object) objects that match a specified query. Requires the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission.

This endpoint utilizes Elasticsearch to power results. This means that while it is very powerful, it's also tricky to use and reliant on the index, meaning results may not be immediately available for a recently-joined member.

<Alert type="warn">

If the guild you are searching is not yet indexed, the endpoint will return a 202 accepted response. The response body will not contain any search results, and will look similar to an error response:

```json
{
  "message": "Index not yet available. Try again later",
  "code": 110000,
  "documents_indexed": 0,
  "retry_after": 15
}
```

You should retry the request after the timeframe specified in the `retry_after` field. If the `retry_after` field is `0`, you should retry the request after a short delay.

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/guilds/{guild.id}/members/{user.id}">
  Get Guild Member
</RouteHeader>

Returns a [guild member](#guild-member-object) object for the specified user.

<RouteHeader method="PUT" url="/guilds/{guild.id}/members/@me">
  Join Guild
</RouteHeader>

Adds the current user to the guild. The guild must be discoverable. If the user is not a member of the guild, returns the [guild](#guild-object) object with the extra fields below. Otherwise, returns a 204 empty response.
May fire a [Guild Create](/topics/gateway-events#guild-create), [Guild Member Add](/topics/gateway-events#guild-member-add), and/or [Guild Join Request Create](/topics/gateway-events#guild-join-request-create) Gateway event.

For guilds with [member verification](#member-verification-object) enabled, this endpoint will default to adding new members as `pending` in the [guild member](#guild-member-object) object. Members that are `pending` will have to complete member verification before they become full members that can talk.

<Alert type="info">

For guilds with [previewing disabled](#guild-previewing), the return type will instead be a partial [guild](#guild-object) object with the extra fields below.

| ----------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| lurker? ^1^             | boolean | Whether the user will lurk the guild (default false)                                                                  |
| session_id?             | string  | The session ID to lurk with, required for lurking                                                                     |

| recommendation_load_id? | string  | The unique identifier for the current guild discovery recommendations (client-generated UUID as a hexadecimal string) |

^1^ Lurking a guild allows the user to receive Gateway events for the guild without being a full member for the lifetime of the Gateway session. This is useful for previewing the guild before joining. Lurking requires the [`PREVIEW_ENABLED` guild feature](#guild-features).

<RouteHeader method="PUT" url="/guilds/{guild.id}/members/{user.id}" supportsOAuth2="guilds.join">
  Add Guild Member
</RouteHeader>

Adds a user to the guild, provided you have a valid OAuth2 access token for the user with the `guilds.join` scope. Returns the joined [guild member](#guild-member-object) object or a 204 empty response (if the user is already a member of the guild) on success. May fire a [Guild Member Add](/topics/gateway-events#guild-member-add) and/or [Guild Join Request Create](/topics/gateway-events#guild-join-request-create) Gateway event.

For guilds with [member verification](#member-verification-object) enabled, this endpoint will default to adding new members as `pending` in the [guild member](#guild-member-object) object. Members that are `pending` will have to complete member verification before they become full members that can talk.
Note that this endpoint ignores whether [guild previewing](#guild-previewing) is enabled and will always join the user as a member.

<Alert type="info">

This endpoint is not usable by user accounts. The Authorization header must be a bot token (belonging to the same application used for authorization), and the bot must be a member of the guild with the `CREATE_INSTANT_INVITE` permission.

^1^ Requires the member to be connected to voice. When moving members to channels, the current user _must_ have permissions to both connect to the channel and have the `MOVE_MEMBERS` permission. If the `channel_id` is set to `null`, this will force the target user to be disconnected from voice.

^2^ Guild administrators cannot be timed out. If a member is timed out and becomes an administrator before their timeout expires, the timeout will no longer have an effect.
