### Member Verification Object

In guilds with [member verification](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000466882) enabled, when a member joins,
a [Guild Member Add](/topics/gateway-events#guild-member-add) Gateway event will be dispatched but they will initially be restricted from doing any actions in the guild, and `pending` will be true in the [guild member](#guild-member-object) object.
When the member completes the verification, a [Guild Member Update](/topics/gateway-events#guild-member-update) Gateway event will be dispatched and `pending` will be false.

To represent a member's progress towards becoming a full member of the guild, a [Guild Join Request Create](/topics/gateway-events#guild-join-request-create) Gateway event will be dispatched. Once the join request is approved, the member's `pending` status will be false and they will be able to interact with the guild.
Unless using [manual approval](#manual-approval), the join request will be automatically approved when the user [submits their join request](#create-guild-join-request).

Assigning a member the [`BYPASSES_VERIFICATION` flag](#guild-member-flags) will force their `pending` status to be false, regardless of the join request's status.

#### Guild Previewing

Discoverable guilds and guilds with member verification enabled have the [`PREVIEW_ENABLED`](#guild-features) feature by default.
This allows the guild to be lurkable by users who are not members, if discoverable, and allows members who have not passed the verification gate to view the guild without interacting with it.

If a guild has member verification enabled and is not previewable, new joiners will not be able to view the guild until they pass the verification gate, and are therefore not considered members until they do.
This means that a [Guild Member Add](/topics/gateway-events#guild-member-add) Gateway event will not be dispatched until the member has passed the verification gate, and `pending` will always be false in the [guild member](#guild-member-object) object for new joiners.
Join requests will continue to be dispatched as normal, but there will not be an associated guild member until the join request is approved.

From the joiner's perspective, they will also not receive a [Guild Create](/topics/gateway-events#guild-create) Gateway event or any other events dispatched from the guild until they pass member verification.
Non-previewable pending guilds can be retrieved with the [Get Join Request Guilds](#get-join-request-guilds) endpoint. Their join requests are also sent in the [`guild_join_requests` field of the Ready event](/topics/gateway-events#ready).

#### Manual Approval

To use [form field types](#member-verification-form-field-type) other than `TERMS`, the guild must have the [`MEMBER_VERIFICATION_MANUAL_APPROVAL` guild feature](#guild-features) enabled.
When using these form field types, join requests must be [manually approved](#action-guild-join-request) after they are [submitted](#create-guild-join-request) before the user can complete member verification.

When only using a [`TERMS` form field type](#member-verification-form-field-type), the join request will be automatically approved when the user [submits the request](#create-guild-join-request).

### Guild Join Request Object

Guild join requests are an extension of [member verification](#member-verification-object) that represent a user's request to join a guild.
A join request is created when a user attempts to join a guild with member verification enabled, and the user must complete the verification process to join the guild.
All join requests are stored for 180 days.

Most join request features require the [`MEMBER_VERIFICATION_MANUAL_APPROVAL` guild feature](#guild-features), as join request are automatically actioned when only using the `TERMS` [form field type](#member-verification-form-field-type) and do not require manual approval.
This includes most of the join request endpoints, such as [Get Guild Join Request](#get-guild-join-request) and [Action Guild Join Request](#modify-guild-join-request).

<Alert type="info">

Guild join requests are not returned to moderators until they are submitted by the user.

### Onboarding Object

The [onboarding](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/11074987197975-Community-Onboarding-FAQ) flow for a guild.

<Alert type="info">

Onboarding enforces constraints when enabled. These constraints are that there must be at least 7 default channels and at least 5 of them must allow sending messages to the default (@everyone) role. The `mode` field modifies what is considered when enforcing these constraints.

^1^ The first member of the array is used to change properties of the guild's default (@everyone) role. If you are trying to bootstrap a guild with additional roles, keep this in mind. Additionally, the required `id` field within each role object is an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to [overwrite](/resources/channel#permission-overwrite-object) a role's permissions in a channel when also passing in channels with the channels array.

^2^ When specified, none of the default channels are created, and the `position` field is always ignored. Additionally, the `id` field within each channel object may be set to an integer placeholder, and will be replaced by the API upon consumption. Its purpose is to allow you to create `GUILD_CATEGORY` channels by setting the `parent_id` field on any children to the category's `id` field. Category channels must be listed before any children.

^3^ Adds the [`INTERNAL_EMPLOYEE_ONLY` guild feature](#guild-features), making the server only available for Discord employees. Only settable by Discord employees.

  Search Guild Members
</RouteHeader>

Returns [supplemental guild member](#supplemental-guild-member-object) objects containing [guild member](#guild-member-object) objects that match a specified query. Requires the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission.

This endpoint utilizes Elasticsearch to power results. This means that while it is very powerful, it's also tricky to use and reliant on the index, meaning results may not be immediately available for a recently-joined member.

<Alert type="warn">

If the guild you are searching is not yet indexed, the endpoint will return a 202 accepted response. The response body will not contain any search results, and will look similar to an error response:

```json
{
  "message": "Index not yet available. Try again later",
  "code": 110000,
  "documents_indexed": 0,
  "retry_after": 15
}
```

You should retry the request after the timeframe specified in the `retry_after` field. If the `retry_after` field is `0`, you should retry the request after a short delay.

^1^ Requires the member to be connected to voice. When moving members to channels, the current user _must_ have permissions to both connect to the channel and have the `MOVE_MEMBERS` permission. If the `channel_id` is set to `null`, this will force the target user to be disconnected from voice.

^2^ Guild administrators cannot be timed out. If a member is timed out and becomes an administrator before their timeout expires, the timeout will no longer have an effect.
