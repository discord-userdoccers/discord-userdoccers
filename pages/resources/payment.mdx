# Payments

Payments are made by the user to Discord in exchange for first and third-party products and services.

## Payment Clients

Payment clients are a concept used to prevent fraudulent transactions across Discord. When a client first attempts to make a payment, it generates a UUIDv4 identifier to be used as the purchase token. This token is then persisted by the client and sent along with all future payment requests.
It is mandatory that all purchase requests include this token in the `purchase_token` field of the request body. The tokens expire after 60 days and must be regenerated.

If Discord detects suspicious activity from a payment client during a transaction, it sends a verification email to the user asking them to authorize the purchase. In the meantime, all purchase requests will fail with a 400 bad request and a [`100056` JSON error code](/topics/opcodes-and-status-codes#json-error-codes):

```json
{
  "message": "This client needs to be authorized for purchases. We've sent you an email. Click the link on the email and then retry the purchase.",
  "code": 100056,
  "payment_id": "1434311883015458937"
}
```

The verification email received will contain a link that redirects to the official Discord client with a verification token present in the URL's fragment (e.g. `https://discord.com/authorize-payment#token=Wzg1Mjg5MjI5NzY2MTkwNjk5MywiN3NtVnNGYWlQNFBQTzIrREgya3JhUVJmZXFlclpvY3UvaFRwcVFBckw5Yz0iXQ.Y5ER6Q.IQhdQcfkK_eHLC16CcFZaYqRP_E`).
After receiving the token, clients can then send a request to the [Verify Purchase Request](#verify-purchase-request) endpoint to complete the authorization process. If the user has not received a link, clients can [choose to resend it](#resend-payment-verification-email).
Upon successful verification, the client will receive a [User Payment Client Add](/topics/gateway-events#user-payment-client-add) Gateway event, which indicates that the purchase can be retried.
