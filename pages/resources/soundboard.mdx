# Soundboard

Soundboard sounds are short audio clips that can be played in voice channels.
There is a set of [default sounds](#get-default-soundboard-sounds) available to all users. Soundboard sounds can also be [created in a guild](#create-guild-soundboard-sound); users will be able to use them in the guild, and premium (Nitro) subscribers can use them in all guilds.

Custom soundboard sounds in a can be retrieved over the Gateway using [Request Soundboard Sounds](/topics/gateway-events#request-soundboard-sounds).

<Collapsible title="Soundboard Limits" description="How are soundboard slots calculated?" icon="list">

Soundboard sound limits are applied to the total amount of sounds in the guild, making them a lot simpler than emoji limits. The default sound limit is 8.
The real limit depends on the guild's [premium tier](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352) and [features](/resources/guild#guild-features).

These limits are summarized in the following table by [premium tier](/resources/guild#premium-tier). Note that if the guild has the [`MORE_SOUNDBOARD` feature](/resources/guild#guild-features), the applied limit is instead 96.

| Premium Tier | Sound Limit |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `NONE`       | 8           |
| `TIER_1`     | 24          |
| `TIER_2`     | 36          |
| `TIER_3`     | 48          |
