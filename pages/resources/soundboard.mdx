# Soundboard Resource

Soundboard sounds are short audio clips that can be played in voice channels.
There is a set of [default sounds](#get-default-soundboard-sounds) available to all users. Soundboard sounds can also be [created in a guild](#create-guild-soundboard-sound); users will be able to use them in the guild, and premium (Nitro) subscribers can use them in all guilds.

Custom soundboard sounds in a can be retrieved over the Gateway using [Request Soundboard Sounds](/topics/gateway-events#request-soundboard-sounds).
