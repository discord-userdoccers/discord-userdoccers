# Directory

A directory in Discord is a special type of channel that contains a list of directory entries, which are guilds and scheduled events that have been added and made discocerable by the community. Any user that can access a directory can view the entries and join the guilds.

Directories are most commonly found in [student hubs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406046651927).
