^1^ The `primary_sku_id` and `slug` fields can be combined to form a URL to the application's primary store page like so: `https://discord.com/store/skus/{primary_sku_id}/{slug}`.

^2^ Only present in responses received after the team was changed.

^3^ In some cases, these fields may still be provided instead of `integration_public` and `integration_require_code_grant`. These fields will not be present if the application does not have a bot.

^4^ The sending of Gateway events over the interactions endpoint requires [interactions version 2](#application-interactions-version).

### Application Role Connection Metadata Object

A representation of role connection metadata for an [application](#application-resource).

When a guild has added an application integration and that integration has configured its [`role_connections_verification_url`](#application-object), the application will render as a potential verification method in the guild's role verification configuration.

If an application has configured role connection metadata, its metadata will appear in the role verification configuration when the application has been added as a verification method to the role.

When a user connects their account using the integration's [`role_connections_verification_url`](#application-object), the integration will [update a user's role connection with metadata](/user#update-user-application-role-connection) using the OAuth2 `role_connections.write` scope.

<Alert type="info">

Each metadata type offers a comparison operation that allows guilds to configure role requirements based on metadata values stored by the bot. Bots specify a `metadata value` for each user and guilds specify the required `guild's configured value` within the guild role settings.
