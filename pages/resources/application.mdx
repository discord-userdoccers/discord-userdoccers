### Application Role Connection Metadata Object

A representation of role connection metadata for an [application](#application-resource).

When a guild has added a bot and that bot has configured its [`role_connections_verification_url`](#application-object), the application will render as a potential verification method in the guild's role verification configuration.

If an application has configured role connection metadata, its metadata will appear in the role verification configuration when the application has been added as a verification method to the role.

When a user connects their account using the bot's [`role_connections_verification_url`](#application-object), the bot will [update a user's role connection with metadata](/user#update-user-application-role-connection) using the OAuth2 `role_connections.write` scope.

<Alert type="info">

Each metadata type offers a comparison operation that allows guilds to configure role requirements based on metadata values stored by the bot. Bots specify a `metadata value` for each user and guilds specify the required `guild's configured value` within the guild role settings.

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader
  method="GET"
  url="/users/@me/applications/{application.id}/role-connection"
  supportsOAuth2="role_connections.write"
>
  Get User Application Role Connection
</RouteHeader>

Returns the [application role connection](#application-role-connection-object) for the user, without optional fields.

<Alert type="warn">

This endpoint is only usable with an OAuth2 access token with the `role_connections.write` scope for the application specified in the path.

</Alert>

<RouteHeader
  method="PUT"
  url="/users/@me/applications/{application.id}/role-connection"
  supportsOAuth2="role_connections.write"

</RouteHeader>

<Alert type="warn">

This endpoint is only usable with an OAuth2 access token with the `role_connections.write` scope for the application specified in the path.

</Alert>

Updates the application's role connection for the user. Returns the updated [application role connection](#application-role-connection-object) object on success.
