^1^ The `primary_sku_id` and `slug` fields can be combined to form a URL to the application's primary store page like so: `https://discord.com/store/skus/{primary_sku_id}/{slug}`.

^2^ Only present when fetched from the [Get Current Application](#get-current-application), [Get Application](#get-application), or [Transfer Application](#transfer-application) endpoints.

^3^ In some cases, these fields may still be provided instead of `integration_public` and `integration_require_code_grant`. These fields will not be present if the application does not have a bot.

^4^ The sending of Gateway events over the interactions endpoint requires [interactions version 2](#application-interactions-version).

^5^ Only applicable for applications of type [`CREATOR_MONETIZATION`](#application-type).

^6^ Only applicable for applications with the [`EMBEDDED` flag](#application-flags).

###### Partial Application Structure

<Alert type="warn">

Partial applications may have any combination of fields, depending on the context in which they are provided. Certain data may be included or omitted depending on what data is needed for the given operation. Fields [marked as required](/reference#nullable-and-optional-resource-fields) will always be present.

Further complicating things, some optional fields may be omitted if their value is `null`, even if the specific partial does include this data.

### Application Role Connection Metadata Object

A representation of role connection metadata for an [application](#application-resource).

When a guild has added an application integration and that integration has configured its [`role_connections_verification_url`](#application-object), the application will render as a potential verification method in the guild's role verification configuration.

If an application has configured role connection metadata, its metadata will appear in the role verification configuration when the application has been added as a verification method to the role.

When a user connects their account using the integration's [`role_connections_verification_url`](#application-object), the integration will [update a user's role connection with metadata](#modify-user-application-role-connection) using the OAuth2 `role_connections.write` scope.

Each metadata type offers a comparison operation that allows guilds to configure role requirements based on metadata values stored by the bot. Bots specify a `metadata value` for each user and guilds specify the required `guild's configured value` within the guild role settings.

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/applications/{application.id}/proxy-config">
  Get Application Proxy Config
</RouteHeader>

Returns the application's [activity proxy config](#application-proxy-config-object) object for the given application ID. User must be the owner of the application or member of the current team.

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/applications/{application.id}/proxy-config">
  Modify Application Proxy Config
</RouteHeader>

Replaces the activity proxy config for the given application ID. User must be the owner of the application or developer of the current team. Returns the updated [application proxy config](#application-proxy-config-object) object on success.

Notes:

- URL mappings can utilize any protocol, so the protocol should be omitted from the `target` field.
- Parameter matching is supported in both the `prefix` and `target` fields. For example, you can map `/server/{id}` to `server-{id}.example.com`.
- Because of how URL globbing works, the order of the mappings is important. The most specific mappings should be at the top of the list as the first match is used. For example, if you have `/foo` and `/foo/bar`, you must place the URL `/foo/bar` before `/foo` or else the mapping for `/foo/bar` will never be reached.
