^1^ `creator_id` will be null and `creator` will not be included for events created before October 25th, 2021, when the concept of `creator_id` was introduced and tracked.

^2^ See [field requirements by entity type](#guild-scheduled-event-entity-type-validation) to understand the relationship between `entity_type` and the following fields: `channel_id`, `entity_metadata`, and `scheduled_end_time`.

^3^ Only included in [Gateway events](/topics/gateway-events#guild-scheduled-events). See [the automations section](#guild-scheduled-event-status-update-automation) for more info on how to determine this manually.

### Guild Scheduled Event Recurrence Rule Object

Discord's recurrence rule is a subset of the behaviors [defined in the iCalendar RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545) and implemented using [Python's dateutil rrule](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rrule.html).

<Collapsible title="System limitations" description="Recurrence rules are powerful, but they have some specific restrictions" icon="warning">

The current system limitations are present due to how reoccurring event data needs to be displayed in the client.
In the future, we would like to open the system up to have fewer / none of these restrictions.

###### The following fields cannot be set by the client

- `count`
- `end`
- `by_year_day`

###### The following combinations are mutually exclusive

- `by_weekday`
- `by_n_weekday`
- `by_month` + `by_month_day`

###### `by_weekday`

- Only valid for daily and weekly events (`frequency` of `DAILY` or `WEEKLY`)
- when used in a daily event (`frequency` is `DAILY`)
  - The values present in the `by_weekday` event must be a "known set" of weekdays.
  - The following are current allowed "sets"
    - Monday - Friday (`[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`)
    - Tuesday - Saturday (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`)
    - Sunday - Thursday (`[6, 0, 1, 2, 3]`)
    - Friday & Saturday (`[4, 5]`)
    - Saturday & Sunday (`[5, 6]`)
    - Sunday & Monday (`[6, 0]`)
- when used in a weekly event (`frequency` is `WEEKLY`)
  - `by_weekday` array currently can only be have length of `1`
    - i.e: You can only select a single day within a week to have a recurring event on
    - If you wish to have multiple days within a week have a recurring event, please use a `frequency` of `DAILY`
  - Also, see `interval` below for "every-other" week information

###### `by_n_weekday`

- Only valid for monthly events (`frequency` of `MONTHLY`)
- `by_n_weekday` array currently can only have a length of `1`
  - i.e: You can only select a single day within a month to have a recurring event on

###### `by_month` and `by_month_day`

- Only valid for annual event (`frequency` is `YEARLY`)
- both `by_month` and `by_month_day` must be provided
- both `by_month` and `by_month_day` arrays must have a length of `1`
  - (i.e. you can only set a single date for annual events)

###### `interval` can only be set to a value other than `1` when `frequency` is set to `WEEKLY`

- In this situation, interval can be set to `2`
- This allowance enables "every-other week" events
- Due to the limitations placed on `by_weekday` this means that if you wish to use "every-other week" functionality
  you can only do so for a single day.

## Guild Scheduled Event Status Update Automation

#### An active scheduled event for a stage channel where all users have left the stage channel will automatically end a few minutes after the last user leaves the channel

When an event with a `status` of `ACTIVE` and `entity_type` of `STAGE_INSTANCE` has no users connected to the stage channel for a certain period of time (on the order of minutes), the event `status` will be automatically set to `COMPLETED`.

#### An active scheduled event for a voice channel where all users have left the voice channel will automatically end a few minutes after the last user leaves the channel

When an event with a `status` of `ACTIVE` and `entity_type` of `VOICE` has no users connected to the voice channel for a certain period of time (on the order of minutes), the event `status` will be automatically set to `COMPLETED`.

#### An external event will automatically begin at its scheduled start time

An event with an `entity_type` of `EXTERNAL` at its `scheduled_start_time` will automatically have `status` set to `ACTIVE`.

#### An external event will automatically end at its scheduled end time

An event with an `entity_type` of `EXTERNAL` at its `scheduled_end_time` will automatically have `status` set to `COMPLETED`.

#### Any scheduled event which has not begun after its scheduled start time will be automatically cancelled after a few hours

Any event with a `status` of `SCHEDULED` after a certain time interval (on the order of hours) beyond its `scheduled_start_time` will have its `status` automatically set to `CANCELED`.
