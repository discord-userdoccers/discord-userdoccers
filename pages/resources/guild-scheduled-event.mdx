## Guild Scheduled Event Status Update Automation

### An active scheduled event for a stage channel where all users have left the stage channel will automatically end a few minutes after the last user leaves the channel

When an event with a `status` of `ACTIVE` and `entity_type` of `STAGE_INSTANCE` has no users connected to the stage channel for a certain period of time (on the order of minutes), the event `status` will be automatically set to `COMPLETED`.

## Guild Scheduled Event Permissions Requirements

<Alert type="info">

A user must be a member of the guild in order to access events for that guild unless the guild is lurkable. If a guild is lurkable,
events in that guild may be visible to lurkers depending on the event type and the permissions of any channels associated with the event.
