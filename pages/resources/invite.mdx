# Invite Resource

Invites are used by users to join a guild or group DM, or to add a user to their friends list.

### Temporary Invites

Temporary invites (indicated by the [`temporary` field](#invite-object)) grant non-permanent access to a guild. Upon [accepting a temporary invite](#accept-invite), the user is added to the guild and can interact with it unconditionally until all of their sessions are disconnected. If the user does not have an active session at the time of accepting the invite, they will be removed after the next time they disconnect.

<Alert type="info">

If the user is granted a role after accepting a temporary invite, they will become permanent members of the guild.

</Alert>

###### Guest Invites

Guest invites (indicated by the [`flags` field](#invite-object)), similar to temporary invites, also grant non-permanent access to a guild. However, unlike temporary invites, upon [accepting a guest invite](#accept-invite), the user does not become a member of the guild. The session ID provided during acceptance is dispatched a [Guild Create](/topics/gateway-events#guild-create) event containing only the channel the invite was for, and the user receives no other guild-specific events (except for [Guild Delete](/topics/gateway-events#guild-delete) when they are removed). Guest access only allows using a subset of endpoints required for interacting with voice channels, and access is removed after the user disconnects from the voice channel.

### Invite Object

A code that when used, adds a user to a guild or group DM channel, or creates a relationship between two users.

^2^ [Temporary invites](#temporary-invites) are only supported for guilds.
