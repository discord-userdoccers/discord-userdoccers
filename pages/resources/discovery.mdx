# Discovery

Discovery is a feature that allows users to find and join new communities on Discord, open to all guilds that meet the requirements. Discovery happens within the client or the [marketing page](https://discord.com/servers).

## Definitions

A guild is considered discoverable by the API if it has the [`DISCOVERABLE` guild feature](/resources/guild#guild-features).
Additionally, any guilds within a directory channel the user has access to (guilds that have the [`HAS_DIRECTORY_ENTRY` guild feature](/resources/guild#guild-features)), like in a student hub, are also considered discoverable relative to the user.

## Searching Discovery

Discord utilizes [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) to power search for discovery. You can search for guilds by name, description, keywords, and more. Reference the [Algolia Search documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/) for more information on how to search. A [proxied version of the Algolia Search API](#search-discoverable-guilds) is available, with limited parameter support.

<Alert type="info">

All hits returned from Algolia are [discoverable guild](#discoverable-guild-object) objects. However, some fields such as `features` are truncated to only include values that are relevant to discovery.

</Alert>

###### Algolia Credentials

<Alert type="danger">

As of December 2024, Discord has revoked the Algolia credentials used for searching discovery. This means that the Algolia index can no longer be accessed directly.

</Alert>

These credentials are for production only.

^1^ Certain guilds, such as those that are [verified](https://discord.com/verification), are exempt from discovery requirements. These guilds will not have a fully populated discovery requirements object, and are guaranteed to receive only `sufficient` and `sufficient_without_grace_period`.
