# Auto Moderation

Auto Moderation, or AutoMod, is a feature which allows each [guild](/resources/guild) to set up rules that trigger based on some criteria. For example, a rule can trigger whenever a message contains a specific keyword.

Rules can be configured to automatically execute actions whenever they trigger. For example, if a user tries to send a message which contains a certain keyword, a rule can trigger and block the message before it is sent.

<Alert type="info">

Users are required to have the `MANAGE_GUILD` permission to access all AutoMod resources.
Some [action types](#automod-action-type) and [alert action types](#automod-alert-action-type) require additional permissions (i.e. the `TIMEOUT_USER` [action type](#automod-action-type) requires an additional `MODERATE_MEMBERS` permission and the `DELETE_USER_MESSAGE` [alert action type](#automod-alert-action-type) requires an additional `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission).

</Alert>

### AutoMod System Messages

AutoMod system messages are sent as standard [messages](/resources/channel#message-object) in the guild with the `AUTO_MODERATION_ACTION` [message type](/resources/channel#message-object-message-types).
If no user is associated with the system message, the author is the AutoMod system account (`1008776202191634432`).

These messages have a special [embed](/resources/channel#embed-object) structure which contains information about the action that was taken.
The custom embed fields below are collapsed as a list of key-value pairs into the `fields` array on the [embed object](/resources/channel#embed-object).

<Alert type="warn">

As [embed field values](/resources/channel#embed-field-structure) are strings, all below fields are serialized as strings, even if the type is specified as otherwise.

</Alert>

#### AutoMod Alert

Sent when a [`SEND_ALERT_MESSAGE` action type](#automod-action-type) is triggered.

The author of the message is the user which generated the content that triggered the rule.
The [embed description](/resources/channel#embed-object) contains the user message content that triggered the rule, if applicable.

^1^ A keyword can be a phrase which contains multiple words. [Wildcard symbols](#automod-keyword-matching-strategies) can be used to customize how each keyword will be matched. Each keyword must be 60 characters or less.

^2^ Only Rust flavored regex is currently supported, which can be tested in online editors such as [Rustexp](https://rustexp.lpil.uk/). Each regex pattern must be 260 characters or less.

^3^ Each `allow_list` keyword can be a phrase which contains multiple words. [Wildcard symbols](#automod-keyword-matching-strategies) can be used to customize how each keyword will be matched. Rules with `KEYWORD` [trigger types](#automod-trigger-type) accept a maximum of 100 keywords. Rules with `KEYWORD_PRESET` [trigger types](#automod-trigger-type) accept a maximum of 1000 keywords.

| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| \*cat\*     | lo**cat**ion, edu**Cat**ion |
| \*tra\*     | abs**tra**cted, ou**tra**ge |
