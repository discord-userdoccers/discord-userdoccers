## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/voice/regions">
  Get Voice Regions
</RouteHeader>

Returns an array of [voice region](#voice-region-object) objects that can be used when setting a [voice channel's `rtc_region`](/resources/channel#channel-object).

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/guilds/{guild.id}/regions">
  Get Guild Voice Regions
</RouteHeader>

Returns a list of [voice region](#voice-region-object) objects that can be used when setting a [voice channel's `rtc_region`](/resources/channel#channel-object). Unlike the similar [Get Voice Regions](#get-voice-regions) route, this returns VIP servers when the guild is VIP-enabled.

<RouteHeader method="PUT" url="/voice/public-keys">
  Upload Voice Public Key
</RouteHeader>

Uploads a persistent public key used for voice encryption. Returns a 204 empty response on success.
