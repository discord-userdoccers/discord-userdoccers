### Voice Region Object

<Alert type="warn">

A special voice region ID of `deprecated` is used as the default in the deprecated [guild `region`](/resources/guild#guild-object) field.

</Alert>

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/voice/regions">
  Get Voice Regions
</RouteHeader>

Returns an array of [voice region](#voice-region-object) objects that can be used when setting a [voice channel's `rtc_region`](/resources/channel#channel-object).

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/guilds/{guild.id}/regions">
  Get Guild Voice Regions
</RouteHeader>

Returns a list of [voice region](#voice-region-object) objects that can be used when setting a [voice channel's `rtc_region`](/resources/channel#channel-object). Unlike the similar [Get Voice Regions](#get-voice-regions) route, this returns VIP servers when the guild is VIP-enabled.

<RouteHeader method="PATCH" url="/guilds/{guild.id}/voice-states/@me">
  Modify Current User Voice State
</RouteHeader>

Updates the current user's voice state in the given guild ID. Returns a 204 empty response on success. Fires a [Voice State Update](/topics/gateway-events#voice-state-update) Gateway event.

###### JSON Params

| Field                       | Type               | Description                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| channel_id?                 | snowflake          | The ID of the channel the user is currently in |
| suppress?                   | boolean            | Whether the user is suppressed in the channel  |
| request_to_speak_timestamp? | ?ISO8601 timestamp | The time at which the user requested to speak  |

###### Caveats

There are currently several caveats for this endpoint:

- `channel_id` must point to a stage channel
- Current user must already have joined `channel_id`
- You must have the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission to unsuppress yourself; you can always suppress yourself
- You must have the `REQUEST_TO_SPEAK` permission to request to speak; you can always clear your own request to speak
- You can only set `request_to_speak_timestamp` to the present or a future time

<RouteHeader method="PATCH" url="/guilds/{guild.id}/voice-states/{user.id}">
  Modify User Voice State
</RouteHeader>

Updates another user's voice state in the given guild ID. Returns a 204 empty response on success. Fires a [Voice State Update](/topics/gateway-events#voice-state-update) Gateway event.

###### JSON Params

| Field      | Type      | Description                                    |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| channel_id | snowflake | The ID of the channel the user is currently in |
| suppress?  | boolean   | Whether the user is suppressed in the channel  |

###### Caveats

There are currently several caveats for this endpoint:

- `channel_id` must point to a stage channel
- Target user must already have joined `channel_id`
- You must have the `MUTE_MEMBERS` permission
- When unsuppressed, user accounts will have their `request_to_speak_timestamp` set to the current time; bot users will not
- When suppressed, the user will have their `request_to_speak_timestamp` removed
