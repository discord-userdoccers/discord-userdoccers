# Audit Logs Resource

When an administrative action is performed in a guild, an entry is added to its audit log. Viewing audit logs requires the `VIEW_AUDIT_LOG` permission and can be fetched using the [Get Guild Audit Log](#get-guild-audit-log) endpoint. All audit log entries are stored for 45 days.

### Audit Reason

When performing an eligible action using the API, users can pass an `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header to indicate why the action was taken. More information is in the [audit log entry](#audit-log-entry-object) section.

| users                  | array[[user](/resources/user#user-object) object]                                                    | Users referenced in the audit log                  |

^1^ Threads referenced in `THREAD_CREATE` and `THREAD_UPDATE` events are included in the threads map, since archived threads might not be kept in memory by clients.

### Audit Log Entry Object

Each audit log entry represents a single administrative action (or [event](#audit-log-events)), indicated by `action_type`. Most entries contain one to many changes in the `changes` array that affected an entity in Discordâ€”whether that's a user, channel, guild, emoji, or something else.

The information (and structure) of an entry's changes will be different depending on its type. For example, in `MEMBER_ROLE_UPDATE` events there is only one change: a member is either added or removed from a specific role. However, in `CHANNEL_CREATE` events there are many changes, including (but not limited to) the channel's name, type, and permission overwrites added. More details are in the [change object](#audit-log-change-object) section.

Users can specify why an administrative action is being taken by passing an `X-Audit-Log-Reason` request header, which will be stored as the audit log entry's `reason` field. The `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header supports up to 512 URL-encoded UTF-8 characters. Reasons are visible in the client and when fetching audit log entries with the API.

| Field       | Type                                                       | Description                                           |

| target_id   | ?string                                                    | ID of the affected entity (webhook, user, role, etc.) |
| changes?    | array[[audit log change](#audit-log-change-object) object] | Changes made to the `target_id``                      |
| user_id     | ?snowflake                                                 | The user who made the changes                         |
| id          | snowflake                                                  | The ID of the entry                                   |
| action_type | integer                                                    | The [type of action](#audit-log-events) that occurred |
| options?    | [optional audit entry info](#optional-audit-entry-info)    | Additional info for certain action types              |
| reason?     | string                                                     | The reason for the change (max 512 characters)        |

<Alert type="warn">

For `APPLICATION_COMMAND_PERMISSION_UPDATE` events, the `target_id` is the command ID or the application ID since the `changes` array represents the entire `permissions` property on the [guild permissions](/interactions/application-commands#guild-application-command-permissions-structure) object.

</Alert>

###### Audit Log Events

The table below lists audit log events and values (the `action_type` field) that you may receive.

The **Object Changed** column notes which object's values may be included in the entry. Though there are exceptions, possible keys in the `changes` array typically correspond to the object's fields. The descriptions and types for those fields can be found in the linked documentation for the object.

If no object is noted, there won't be a `changes` array in the entry, though other fields like the `target_id` still exist and many have fields in the [`options` array](#optional-audit-entry-info).

<Alert type="info">

You should assume that you may run into any field for the changed object, though none are guaranteed to be present. In most cases only a subset of the object's fields will be in the `changes` array.

### Audit Log Change Object

Many audit log events include a `changes` array in their [entry object](#audit-log-entry-structure). The [structure for the individual changes](#audit-log-change-structure) varies based on the event type and its changed objects, so apps shouldn't depend on a single pattern of handling audit log events.

###### Audit Log Change Structure

Some events don't follow the same pattern as other audit log events. Details about these exceptions are explained in [the next section](#audit-log-change-exceptions).

<Alert type="info">

If `new_value` is not present in the change object while `old_value` is, it indicates that the property has been reset or set to `null`. If `old_value` isn't included, it indicated that the property was previously `null`.

</Alert>

| Field      | Type                                | Description                                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| new_value? | mixed (matches object field's type) | New value of the key                                                              |
| old_value? | mixed (matches object field's type) | Old value of the key                                                              |
| key        | string                              | Name of the changed entity, with a few [exceptions](#audit-log-change-exceptions) |

###### Audit Log Change Exceptions

For most objects, the change keys may be any field on the changed object. The following table details the exceptions to this pattern.

<Alert type="info">

In addition to the exceptions below, the `key` field may be appended with `_hash` when the change is related to a CDN asset. For example, `banner_hash` is present instead of `banner`.
