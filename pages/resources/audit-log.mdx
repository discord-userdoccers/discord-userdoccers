# Audit Logs Resource

## Audit Logs

Whenever an admin action is performed on the API, an entry is added to the respective guild's audit log.

### X-Audit-Log-Reason

Certain endpoints support the `X-Audit-Log-Reason` header, which adds a reason in the audit log entry created from the action that was executed. This header supports url encoded UTF8 characters.
