^1^ The `author` object follows the structure of the user object, but may not be a valid user in the case where the message is generated by a webhook; you can recognize this by checking for the `webhook_id` key on the message object. In these cases, the below notice about the additional `member` keys does not apply as webhooks are not guild members.

^2^ Users must configure (or, in the case of bots, be approved for) the [`MESSAGE_CONTENT` intent](/topics/gateway#message-content-intent) to receive non-empty values for these fields in most situations.

^3^ Not all channel mentions in a message will appear in `mention_channels`. Only textual channels that are visible to everyone in a lurkable guild will ever be included. Only crossposted messages (via Channel Following) currently include `mention_channels` at all. If no mentions in the message meet these requirements, this field will not be sent.

^4^ Only returned for messages with a `type` of `REPLY` or `THREAD_STARTER_MESSAGE`. If the message is a reply but the `referenced_message` field is not present, the backend did not attempt to fetch the message that was being replied to, so its state is unknown. If the field exists but is `null`, the referenced message was deleted.

#### Message Types

There are multiple message types that have a `message_reference` object. Since message references are generic attribution to a previous message, there will be more types of messages which have this information in the future.

###### Crosspost Messages

- These are messages that originated from another channel (`IS_CROSSPOST` flag).
- These messages have all three fields, with data of the original message that was crossposted.

###### Channel Follow Add Messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a channel is followed into the current channel (type `12`).
- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, with data of the followed announcement channel.

###### Pin Messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a message is pinned (type `6`).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, with data of the message that was pinned.

###### Reply Messages

- These are messages replying to a previous message (type `19`).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, with data of the message that was replied to. The `channel_id` and `guild_id` will be the same as the reply.
- Replies are created by including a `message_reference` when sending a message. When sending, only `message_id` is required.

###### Thread Created Messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a public thread is created from an old message or without a message (type `18`).
- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, with data of the created thread channel.

###### Thread Starter Messages

- These are the first message in public threads created from messages. They point back to the message in the parent channel from which the thread was started (type `21`).
- These messages have `message_id`, `channel_id`, and `guild_id`.
- These messages will never have `content`, `embeds`, or `attachments`, mainly just the `message_reference` and `referenced_message` fields.

###### Voice Messages

Voice messages are messages with the `VOICE_MESSAGE` flag. They have the following properties:

- They cannot be edited.
- Only a single audio attachment is allowed. No other attachments, content, embeds, stickers, etc.
- The [attachment](#attachment-object) has the additional fields `duration_secs` and `waveform`.

The `waveform` is intended to be a preview of the entire voice message, with 1 byte per datapoint encoded in base64.
Official clients sample the recording at most once per 100 milliseconds, but will downsample so that no more than 256 datapoints are in the waveform.

Official clients upload a 1 channel, 48000 Hz, 32 kbps Opus stream in an OGG container.
The encoding and waveform details are an implementation detail and may change without warning.

###### Clips

Clips are a special type of attachment that can be sent with a message. They are created by recording a stream and then clipping a portion of the recording.

Clip [attachments](#attachment-object) have the [`CLIP` flag](#attachment-flags) set, and have the additional fields `clip_created_at`, `clip_participants`, and optionally `title` and `application`.

An attachment can be sent as a clip by specifying the `is_clip`, `clip_created_at`, and `clip_participant_ids` fields, and optionally the `title` and `application_id` fields.
For an attachment to be a valid clip, it must have a UUID appended to the end of the file in binary format. An example in hexadecimal format is `75 75 69 64 A1 C8 52 99 33 46 4D B8 88 F0 83 F5 7A 75 A5 EF`.
This can be done with the following pseudocode:

```py
import uuid

with open("cat.mp4", "r+b") as file:
    file.seek(0, 2)
    file.write(b"uuid")
    file.write(uuid.uuid4().bytes)
```

^1^ These embed types are system-generated and cannot be sent by users. Their [`fields` array](#embed-object) represents the object linked in the description as a list of key-value pairs.

^2^ This embed type is used to signal to the client to render a [preview of the linked media channel post](#get-channel-media-preview). This embed is created for URLs that link to a media channel post if the channel is a paywalled role subscription benefit. The URL is always in the format `https://discord.com/channels/:guild_id/:parent_id/threads/:thread_id/:initial_message_id`.

^1^ Ephemeral attachments will automatically be removed after a set period of time. Ephemeral attachments on messages are guaranteed to be available as long as the message itself exists.

^2^ This field is send-only. See [Uploading to Google Cloud](/reference#uploading-to-google-cloud) for more information.

^3^ The `flags` field is not sendable. To set flags, use the `is_clip`, `is_thumbnail`, and `is_remix` send-only fields.

^4^ When sending a clip, `is_clip`, `clip_created_at`, and `clip_participant_ids` are required. [See message types](#clips) for more information.

^5^ The `clip_participant_ids` and `application_id` fields are send-only. You will receive the `clip_participants` and `application` fields back when retrieving the [message](#message-object).

### Allowed Mentions Object

The allowed mention field allows for more granular control over mentions without various hacks to the message content. This will always validate against message content to avoid phantom pings (e.g. to ping everyone, you must still have `@everyone` in the message content), and check against user permissions.

###### Allowed Mention Types

| Value    | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| roles    | Controls role mentions                |
| users    | Controls user mentions                |
| everyone | Controls @everyone and @here mentions |

###### Allowed Mentions Structure

| Field         | Type             | Description                                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| parse?        | array[string]    | The [allowed mention types](#allowed-mention-types) to parse from the content              |
| roles?        | array[snowflake] | The role IDs to mention (max 100)                                                          |
| users?        | array[snowflake] | The user IDs to mention (max 100)                                                          |
| replied_user? | boolean          | For replies, whether to mention the author of the message being replied to (default false) |

###### Allowed Mentions Reference

Due to the complexity of possibilities, we have included a set of examples and behavior for the allowed mentions field.

If `allowed_mentions` is _not_ passed in (i.e. the key does not exist), the mentions will be parsed via the content. This corresponds with existing behavior.

In the example below we would ping @here (and also @role124 and @user123)

```json
{
  "content": "@here Hi there from <@123>, cc <@&124>"
}
```

To suppress all mentions in a message use:

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone hi there, <@&123>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": []
  }
}
```

This will suppress _all_ mentions in the message (no @everyone or user mention).

The `parse` field is mutually exclusive with the other fields. In the example below, we would ping users `123` and role `124`, but _not_ @everyone. Note that passing a falsy value ([], `null`) into the `users` field does not trigger a validation error.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@&124>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users", "roles"],
    "users": []
  }
}
```

In the next example, we would ping @everyone, (and also users `123` and `124` if they suppressed
@everyone mentions), but we would not ping any roles.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["everyone"],
    "users": ["123", "124"]
  }
}
```

Due to possible ambiguities, not all configurations are valid. An _invalid_ configuration is as follows

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users"],
    "users": ["123", "124"]
  }
}
```

Because `parse: ["users"]` and `users: ["123", "124"]` are both present, we would throw a validation error.
This is because the conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously (they are mutually exclusive).

Any entities with an ID included in the list of IDs can be mentioned. Note that the IDs of entities not present in the message's content will simply be ignored.
e.g. The following example is valid, and would mention user 123, but _not_ user 125 since there is no mention of
user 125 in the content.

```json
{
  "content": "<@123> Time for some memes.",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "users": ["123", "125"]
  }
}
```

### Poll Object

The poll object has a lot of levels and nested structures. It was also designed
to support future extensibility, so some fields may appear to be more complex than
necessary.

###### Poll Structure

| Field             | Type                                                | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| question ^1^      | [poll media](#poll-media-structure) object          | The question of the poll                         |
| answers           | array[[poll answer](#poll-answer-structure) object] | The answers available in the poll                |
| expiry ^2^        | ?IS08601 timestamp                                  | When the poll ends                               |
| allow_multiselect | boolean                                             | Whether a user can select multiple answers       |
| layout_type       | integer                                             | The [layout type](#poll-layout-type) of the poll |
| results?          | [poll results](#poll-results-structure) object      | The results of the poll                          |

^1^ Only `text` is supported.

^2^ `expiry` is marked as nullable to support non-expiring polls in the future, but all polls have an expiry currently.

###### Poll Create Structure

This is the request object used when creating a poll across the different endpoints.
It is similar but not exactly identical to the main [poll](#poll-structure) object.
The main difference is that the request has `duration` which eventually becomes `expiry`.

| Field              | Type                                                | Description                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| question ^1^       | [poll media](#poll-media-structure) object          | The question of the poll                                             |
| answers            | array[[poll answer](#poll-answer-structure) object] | Each of the answers available in the poll (max 10)                   |
| duration           | integer                                             | Number of hours the poll should be open for (max 7 days)             |
| allow_multiselect? | boolean                                             | Whether a user can select multiple answers (default false)           |
| layout_type?       | integer                                             | The [layout type](#poll-layout-type) of the poll (default `DEFAULT`) |

^1^ Only `text` is supported.

###### Poll Layout Type

Different layouts for polls will come in the future. For now though, this value will always be `DEFAULT`.

| Value | Name                   | Description                           |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1     | DEFAULT                | The default layout type               |
| ~~2~~ | ~~IMAGE_ONLY_ANSWERS~~ | ~~Poll answers can have only images~~ |

###### Poll Media Structure

The poll media object is a common object that backs both the question and answers.
For now, `question` only supports `text`, while answers can have an optional `emoji`.

| Field      | Type                                           | Description                                                                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| text? ^1^  | string                                         | The text of the field (max 300 characters for question, 55 characters for answer) |
| emoji? ^2^ | partial [emoji](/resources/emoji#emoji-object) | The emoji of the field                                                            |

^1^ `text` should always be non-null for both questions and answers, but please do not depend on that in the future.

^2^ When creating a poll answer with an emoji, one only needs to send either the `id` (custom emoji) or `name` (default emoji) as the only field.

###### Poll Answer Structure

The `answer_id` is a number that labels each answer.
As an implementation detail, it currently starts at 1 for the first answer and goes up sequentially.
We recommend against depending on this sequence.

Currently, there is a maximum of 10 answers per poll.

| Field         | Type                                       | Description            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| answer_id ^1^ | integer                                    | The ID of the answer   |
| poll_media    | [poll media](#poll-media-structure) object | The data of the answer |

^1^ When sending, this field is optional.

###### Poll Results Structure

In a nutshell, this contains the number of votes for each answer.
The `results` field may be not present in certain responses where, as an implementation detail, Discord does not fetch the poll results in the backend.
This should be treated as "unknown results", as opposed to "no results". You can keep using the results if you have previously received them through other means.
Due to the intricacies of counting at scale, while a poll is in progress the results may not be perfectly accurate.
They usually are accurate, and shouldn't deviate significantly—it's just difficult to make guarantees.
To compensate for this, after a poll is finished there is a background job which performs a final, accurate tally of votes.
This tally concludes once `is_finalized` is `true`. Polls that have ended will also always contain results.
If `answer_counts` does not contain an entry for a particular answer, then there are no votes for that answer.

| Field         | Type                                                            | Description                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| is_finalized  | boolean                                                         | Whether the votes have been precisely counted |
| answer_counts | array[[poll answer count](#poll-answer-count-structure) object] | The counts for each answer                    |

###### Poll Answer Count Structure

| Field    | Type    | Description                                    |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| id       | integer | The ID of the answer                           |
| count    | integer | The number of votes for this answer            |
| me_voted | boolean | Whether the current user voted for this answer |

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages">
  Get Messages
</RouteHeader>

Returns an array of [message](#message-object) objects in the channel. Requires the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission if operating on a guild channel. If the current user is missing the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission in the channel then this will return no messages (since they cannot read the message history).

###### Query String Params

| Field   | Type      | Description                                          |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| around? | snowflake | Get messages around this message ID                  |
| before? | snowflake | Get messages before this message ID                  |
| after?  | snowflake | Get messages after this message ID                   |
| limit   | integer   | Max number of messages to return (1-100, default 50) |

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/guilds/{guild.id}/messages/search OR /channels/{channel.id}/messages/search">
  Search Messages
</RouteHeader>

Returns messages without the `reactions` key that match a search query in the guild or channel. The messages that are direct results will have an extra `hit` key set to `true`. Requires the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission if operating on a guild channel.

<Alert type="warn">

If the guild/channel you are searching is not yet indexed, the endpoint will return a 202 accepted response. The response body will not contain any search results, and will look similar to an error response:

```json
{
  "message": "Index not yet available. Try again later",
  "code": 110000,
  "documents_indexed": 0,
  "retry_after": 2
}
```

You should retry the request after the timeframe specified in the `retry_after` field. If the `retry_after` field is `0`, you should retry the request after a short delay.

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages/{message.id}">
  Get Message
</RouteHeader>

Returns a specific [message](#message-object) object in the channel. Requires the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission if operating on a guild channel.

<Alert type="warn">

This endpoint is not usable by user accounts.

</Alert>

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages">
  Create Message
</RouteHeader>

<Alert type="warn">

Discord may strip certain characters from message content, like invalid unicode characters or characters which cause unexpected message formatting. If you are passing user-generated strings into message content, consider sanitizing the data to prevent unexpected behavior and using `allowed_mentions` to prevent unexpected mentions.

</Alert>

Posts a message to a text-based channel. Returns a [message](#message-object) object on success. Fires a [Message Create](/topics/gateway-events#message-create) Gateway event. See [message formatting](/reference#message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.

To create a message as a reply to another message, you can include a [`message_reference`](#message-reference-object) with a `message_id`. The `channel_id` and `guild_id` in the `message_reference` are optional, but will be validated if provided.

Files must be attached using a `multipart/form-data` body (or pre-uploaded to Discord's GCP bucket) as described in [Uploading Files](/reference#uploading-files).

###### Limitations

- When operating on a guild channel, the current user must have the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission.
- When sending a message with `poll`, the current user must have the `SEND_POLLS` permission.
- When sending a message with `tts` (text-to-speech) set to `true`, the current user must have the `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` permission.
- When creating a message as a reply to another message, the current user must have the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission.
  - The referenced message must exist and cannot be a system message.
- The maximum request size when sending a message is **100 MiB**.
- For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.

<Alert type="info">

Note that when sending a message, you must provide a value for **at least one of** `content`, `embeds`, `components`, `sticker_ids`, `activity`, `files[n]`, or `poll`.

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages/{message.id}/ack">
  Acknowledge Message
</RouteHeader>

Sets the channel's latest acknowledged message (marks a message as read) for the current user. Fires a [Message Ack](/topics/gateway-events#message-ack) Gateway event.

The message ID parameter does not need to be a valid message ID, but it must be a valid snowflake. If the message ID is being set to a message sent prior to the latest acknowledged one, `manual` should be `true` or the resulting read state update should be ignored by clients (but is still saved), resulting in undefined behavior. In this case, `mention_count` should also be set to the amount of mentions unacknowledged as it is not automatically calculated by Discord.

When specifying flags, ensure to include all previously set flags/bits in addition to ones that you are modifying.

When the `content` field is edited, the `mentions` array in the message object will be reconstructed from scratch based on the new content. The `allowed_mentions` field of the edit request controls how this happens. If there is no explicit `allowed_mentions` in the edit request, the content will be parsed with _default_ allowances, that is, without regard to whether or not an `allowed_mentions` was present in the request that originally created the message.

Returns a [message](#message-object) object. Fires a [Message Update](#message-object) Gateway event.

Refer to [Uploading Files](/reference#uploading-files) for details on attachments and `multipart/form-data` requests.
Any provided files will be **appended** to the message. To remove or replace files you will have to supply the `attachments` field which specifies the files to retain on the message after edit.

<Alert type="warn">

Starting with API v10, the `attachments` array must contain all attachments that should be present after edit, including **retained and new** attachments provided in the request body.
