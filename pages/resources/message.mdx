\* The `author` object follows the structure of the user object, but may not be a valid user in the case where the message is generated by a webhook; you can recognize this by checking for the `webhook_id` key on the message object. In these cases, the below notice about the additional `member` keys does not apply as webhooks are not guild members.

\*\* Not all channel mentions in a message will appear in `mention_channels`. Only textual channels that are visible to everyone in a lurkable guild will ever be included. Only crossposted messages (via Channel Following) currently include `mention_channels` at all. If no mentions in the message meet these requirements, this field will not be sent.

\*\*\* This field is only returned for messages with a `type` of `REPLY` or `THREAD_STARTER_MESSAGE`. If the message is a reply but the `referenced_message` field is not present, the backend did not attempt to fetch the message that was being replied to, so its state is unknown. If the field exists but is `null`, the referenced message was deleted.

#### Message Types

There are multiple message types that have a `message_reference` object. Since message references are generic attribution to a previous message, there will be more types of messages which have this information in the future.

###### Crosspost Messages

- These are messages that originated from another channel (`IS_CROSSPOST` flag).
- These messages have all three fields, with data of the original message that was crossposted.

###### Channel Follow Add Messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a channel is followed into the current channel (type `12`).
- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, with data of the followed announcement channel.

###### Pin Messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a message is pinned (type `6`).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, with data of the message that was pinned.

###### Reply Messages

- These are messages replying to a previous message (type `19`).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, with data of the message that was replied to. The `channel_id` and `guild_id` will be the same as the reply.
- Replies are created by including a `message_reference` when sending a message. When sending, only `message_id` is required.

###### Thread Created messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a public thread is created from an old message or without a message (type `18`).
- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, with data of the created thread channel.

###### Thread Starter Messages

- These are the first message in public threads created from messages. They point back to the message in the parent channel from which the thread was started (type `21`).
- These messages have `message_id`, `channel_id`, and `guild_id`.
- These messages will never have `content`, `embeds`, or `attachments`, mainly just the `message_reference` and `referenced_message` fields.

\*\* This field is send-only. See [Uploading to GCP](/reference#uploading-to-gcp) for more information.

### Allowed Mentions Object

The allowed mention field allows for more granular control over mentions without various hacks to the message content. This will always validate against message content to avoid phantom pings (e.g. to ping everyone, you must still have `@everyone` in the message content), and check against user permissions.

###### Allowed Mention Types

| Value    | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| roles    | Controls role mentions                |
| users    | Controls user mentions                |
| everyone | Controls @everyone and @here mentions |

###### Allowed Mentions Structure

| Field         | Type             | Description                                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| parse?        | array[string]    | The [allowed mention types](#allowed-mention-types) to parse from the content              |
| roles?        | array[snowflake] | The role IDs to mention (max 100)                                                          |
| users?        | array[snowflake] | The user IDs to mention (max 100)                                                          |
| replied_user? | boolean          | For replies, whether to mention the author of the message being replied to (default false) |

###### Allowed Mentions Reference

Due to the complexity of possibilities, we have included a set of examples and behavior for the allowed mentions field.

If `allowed_mentions` is _not_ passed in (i.e. the key does not exist), the mentions will be parsed via the content. This corresponds with existing behavior.

In the example below we would ping @here (and also @role124 and @user123)

```json
{
  "content": "@here Hi there from <@123>, cc <@&124>"
}
```

To suppress all mentions in a message use:

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone hi there, <@&123>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": []
  }
}
```

This will suppress _all_ mentions in the message (no @everyone or user mention).

The `parse` field is mutually exclusive with the other fields. In the example below, we would ping users `123` and role `124`, but _not_ @everyone. Note that passing a falsy value ([], `null`) into the `users` field does not trigger a validation error.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@&124>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users", "roles"],
    "users": []
  }
}
```

In the next example, we would ping @everyone, (and also users `123` and `124` if they suppressed
@everyone mentions), but we would not ping any roles.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["everyone"],
    "users": ["123", "124"]
  }
}
```

Due to possible ambiguities, not all configurations are valid. An _invalid_ configuration is as follows

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users"],
    "users": ["123", "124"]
  }
}
```

Because `parse: ["users"]` and `users: ["123", "124"]` are both present, we would throw a validation error.
This is because the conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously (they are mutually exclusive).

Any entities with an ID included in the list of IDs can be mentioned. Note that the IDs of entities not present in the message's content will simply be ignored.
e.g. The following example is valid, and would mention user 123, but _not_ user 125 since there is no mention of
user 125 in the content.

```json
{
  "content": "<@123> Time for some memes.",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "users": ["123", "125"]
  }
}
```

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages">
  Get Messages
</RouteHeader>

Returns an array of [message](#message-object) objects in the channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission to be present on the current user. If the current user is missing the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission in the channel then this will return no messages (since they cannot read the message history).

###### Query String Params

| Field   | Type      | Description                                          |

| before? | snowflake | Get messages before this message ID                  |
| after?  | snowflake | Get messages after this message ID                   |
| limit   | integer   | Max number of messages to return (1-100, default 50) |

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages/search">
  Search Messages
</RouteHeader>

Returns messages without the `reactions` key that match a search query in the channel. The messages that are direct results will have an extra `hit` key set to `true`. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission to be present on the current user.

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages/{message.id}">
  Get Message
</RouteHeader>

Returns a specific [message](#message-object) object in the channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission to be present on the current user.

<Alert type="warn">

This endpoint is not usable by user accounts.

</Alert>

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages">
  Create Message
</RouteHeader>

<Alert type="warn">

Discord may strip certain characters from message content, like invalid unicode characters or characters which cause unexpected message formatting. If you are passing user-generated strings into message content, consider sanitizing the data to prevent unexpected behavior and using `allowed_mentions` to prevent unexpected mentions.

</Alert>

Posts a message to a text-based channel. Returns a [message](#message-object) object on success. Fires a [Message Create](/topics/gateway#message-create) Gateway event. See [message formatting](/reference#message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.

To create a message as a reply to another message, you can include a [`message_reference`](#message-reference-object) with a `message_id`. The `channel_id` and `guild_id` in the `message_reference` are optional, but will be validated if provided.

Files must be attached using a `multipart/form-data` body as described in [Uploading Files](/reference#uploading-files).

###### Limitations

- When operating on a guild channel, the current user must have the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission.
- When sending a message with `tts` (text-to-speech) set to `true`, the current user must have the `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` permission.
- When creating a message as a reply to another message, the current user must have the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission.
  - The referenced message must exist and cannot be a system message.
- The maximum request size when sending a message is `8 MiB`.
- For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.

<Alert type="info">

Note that when sending a message, you must provide a value for **at least one of** `content`, `embeds`, `components`, `sticker_ids`, or `files[n]`.

<RouteHeader method="DELETE" url="/channels/{channel.id}/attachments/{cloud_attachment.upload_filename}">
  Delete Attachment
</RouteHeader>

Deletes an attachment from Discord's GCP storage bucket. Returns a 204 empty response on success.

</RouteHeader>

Sets the channel's latest acknowledged message (marks a message as read) for the current user. Fires a [Message Ack](/topics/gateway#message-ack) Gateway event.

The message ID parameter does not need to be a valid message ID, but it must be a valid snowflake. If the message ID is being set to a message sent prior to the latest acknowledged one, `manual` should be `true` or the resulting read state update should be ignored by clients (but is still saved), resulting in undefined behavior. In this case, `mention_count` should also be set to the amount of mentions unacknowledged as it is not automatically calculated by Discord.

When specifying flags, ensure to include all previously set flags/bits in addition to ones that you are modifying.

When the `content` field is edited, the `mentions` array in the message object will be reconstructed from scratch based on the new content. The `allowed_mentions` field of the edit request controls how this happens. If there is no explicit `allowed_mentions` in the edit request, the content will be parsed with _default_ allowances, that is, without regard to whether or not an `allowed_mentions` was present in the request that originally created the message.

Returns a [message](#message-object) object. Fires a [Message Update](#message-object) Gateway event.

Refer to [Uploading Files](/reference#uploading-files) for details on attachments and `multipart/form-data` requests.
Any provided files will be **appended** to the message. To remove or replace files you will have to supply the `attachments` field which specifies the files to retain on the message after edit.

<Alert type="warn">

Starting with API v10, the `attachments` array must contain all attachments that should be present after edit, including **retained and new** attachments provided in the request body.
