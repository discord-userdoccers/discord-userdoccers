^1^ The `author` object follows the structure of the user object, but may not be a valid user in the case where the message is generated by a webhook; you can recognize this by checking for the `webhook_id` key on the message object. In these cases, the below notice about the additional `member` keys does not apply as webhooks are not guild members.

^2^ Users must configure (or, in the case of bots, be approved for) the [`MESSAGE_CONTENT` intent](/topics/gateway#message-content-intent) to receive non-empty values for these fields in most situations.

^3^ Not all channel mentions in a message will appear in `mention_channels`. Only textual channels that are visible to everyone in a lurkable guild will ever be included. Only crossposted messages (via Channel Following) currently include `mention_channels` at all. If no mentions in the message meet these requirements, this field will not be sent.

^4^ See the [message reference types](#message-reference-type) for more information on which message references have which fields.

^5^ This field is only returned for messages with a `type` of `REPLY`, `THREAD_STARTER_MESSAGE`, or `CONTEXT_MENU_COMMAND`. If the message is one of these but the `referenced_message` field is not present, the backend did not attempt to fetch the message, so its state is unknown. If the field exists but is `null`, the referenced message was deleted.

^1^ If the message was sent in a lobby and the lobby has no channel linked, this will be equal to the ID of the lobby.

^2^ These fields will be present only in ephemeral DM channels.

###### User Join Message Type

Usually, the type of rendered message is determined via converting the message's `timestamp` to a unix timestamp with millisecond precision, modulo 13.

| Value | Rendered Content                                |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | "{author} joined the party."                    |
| 1     | "{author} is here."                             |
| 2     | "Welcome, {author}. We hope you brought pizza." |
| 3     | "A wild {author} appeared."                     |
| 4     | "{author} just landed."                         |
| 5     | "{author} just slid into the server."           |
| 6     | "{author} just showed up!"                      |
| 7     | "Welcome {author}. Say hi!"                     |
| 8     | "{author} hopped into the server."              |
| 9     | "Everyone welcome {author}!"                    |
| 10    | "Glad you're here, {author}."                   |
| 11    | "Good to see you, {author}."                    |
| 12    | "Yay you made it, {author}!"                    |

However, if the guild has the [`CLAN` feature](/resources/guild#guild-features), the same is determined via dividing the message's `timestamp` with millisecond precision by modulo 10.

See the below table for the system welcome messages specific to clans.

| Value | Rendered Content                                                                |

| 1     | "A new member has spawned. Say hi to {author}."                                 |
| 2     | "{author} just joined the Guild. We hope you brought pizza."                    |
| 3     | "Glad you're here, {author}, welcome to the Guild."                             |
| 4     | "New recruit! {author} joined the Guild."                                       |
| 5     | "Round of applause for the newest Guild member, {author}. Just for being here." |
| 6     | "Rolling out the red carpet for {author}. Say hi!"                              |
| 7     | "Yahaha! {author} found us!"                                                    |
| 8     | "Get ready everyone -- a {author} has appeared!"                                |
| 9     | "Roses are red, violets are blue, {author} just joined the Guild with you."     |

#### Message Types

There are multiple message types that have a `message_reference` object. Since message references are generic attribution to a previous message, there will be more types of messages which have this information in the future.

###### Crosspost Messages

- These are messages that originated from another channel (`IS_CROSSPOST` flag).
- These messages have all three fields, with data of the original message that was crossposted.

###### Forwarded Messages

- These are messages which capture a snapshot of a message, preventing spoofing or tampering (`HAS_SNAPSHOT` flag).
- These messages have an array of [`message_snapshots`](#message-snapshot-object) field containing a copy of the original message. This copy follows the same structure as a message, but has only the minimal set of fields returned required for context/rendering.
- A forwarded message can be identified by looking at it's `message_reference.type` field.
  - Message snapshots will be the message data associated with the forward. Currently only 1 snapshot is supported.
  - Message snapshots are taken at moment the forward message is created, and are **immutable**; any mutations to the orignal message will not be propagated.
- Forwards are created by including a [`message_reference`](#message-reference-object) of a [`FORWARD`](#message-reference-type) type when sending a message. When sending, `type`, `message_id`, and `channel_id` are required, and the requester must have `VIEW_CHANNEL` permissions.
- You can opt to only include specific attachments and embed in the forward by including the [`forward_only` field in the `message_reference`](#message-reference-object).
- Stricter rate limits for this feature have been applied based on:
  - Number of forwards sent
  - Total attachment size

###### Channel Follow Add Messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a channel is followed into the current channel (type `12`).
- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, with data of the followed announcement channel.

###### Pin Messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a message is pinned (type `6`).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, with data of the message that was pinned.

###### Reply Messages

- These are messages replying to a previous message (type `19`).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, with data of the message that was replied to. The `channel_id` and `guild_id` will be the same as the reply.
- Replies are created by including a `message_reference` when sending a message. When sending, only `message_id` is required.

###### Thread Created Messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a public thread is created from an old message or without a message (type `18`).
- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, with data of the created thread channel.

###### Thread Starter Messages

- These are the first message in public threads created from messages. They point back to the message in the parent channel from which the thread was started (type `21`).
- These messages have `message_id`, `channel_id`, and `guild_id`.
- These messages will never have `content`, `embeds`, or `attachments`, mainly just the `message_reference` and `referenced_message` fields.

###### Voice Messages

Voice messages are messages with the `VOICE_MESSAGE` flag. They have the following properties:

- They cannot be edited.
- Only a single audio attachment is allowed. No other attachments, content, embeds, stickers, etc.
- The [attachment](#attachment-object) has the additional fields `duration_secs` and `waveform`. The `Content-Type` of the attachment must begin with `audio/` to respect these fields.

The `waveform` is intended to be a preview of the entire voice message, with 1 byte per datapoint encoded in base64.
Official clients sample the recording at most once per 100 milliseconds, but will downsample so that no more than 256 datapoints are in the waveform.

When uploading a voice message attachment directly, the provided content type must match an audio content type to support the additional fields.

Official clients upload a 1 channel, 48000 Hz, 32 kbps Opus stream in an OGG container.
The encoding and waveform details are an implementation detail and may change without warning.

###### Clips

Clips are a special type of attachment that can be sent with a message. They are created by recording a stream and then clipping a portion of the recording.

Clip [attachments](#attachment-object) have the [`CLIP` flag](#attachment-flags) set, and have the additional fields `clip_created_at`, `clip_participants`, and optionally `title` and `application`.

An attachment can be sent as a clip by specifying the `is_clip`, `clip_created_at`, and `clip_participant_ids` fields, and optionally the `title` and `application_id` fields.
For an attachment to be a valid clip, it must have a UUID appended to the end of the file in binary format. An example in hexadecimal format is `75 75 69 64 A1 C8 52 99 33 46 4D B8 88 F0 83 F5 7A 75 A5 EF`.
This can be done with the following pseudocode:

```py
import uuid

with open("cat.mp4", "r+b") as file:
    file.seek(0, 2)
    file.write(b"uuid")
    file.write(uuid.uuid4().bytes)
```

### Embed Object

<Alert type="info">

The combined sum of characters in all `title`, `description`, `field.name`, `field.value`, `footer.text`, and `author.name` fields across all embeds attached to a message must not exceed 6000 characters. Leading and trailing whitespace characters are trimmed automatically.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

Embeds are deduplicated by URL. If a message contains multiple embeds with the same URL, only the first is shown. If the duplicates have additional images, all images are shown in a grid in the first embed.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

The media proxy caches link embeds for 30 minutes.

###### Embed Type

Most embed types are "loosely defined" and, for the most part, are not used by our clients for rendering. Embed attributes power what is rendered.

^1^ These embed types are system-generated and cannot be sent by users. Their [`fields` array](#embed-object) represents the object linked in the description as a list of key-value pairs.

^2^ See the [poll result notifications](#poll-result-notifications) section for more information.

^3^ This embed type is used to signal to the client to render a [preview of the linked media channel post](#get-channel-media-preview). This embed is created for URLs that link to a media channel post if the channel is a paywalled role subscription benefit. The URL is always in the format `https://discord.com/channels/:guild_id/:parent_id/threads/:thread_id/:initial_message_id`.

^1^ Ephemeral attachments will automatically be removed after a set period of time. Ephemeral attachments on messages are guaranteed to be available as long as the message itself exists.

^2^ These fields are received only and cannot be set.

^3^ This field is send-only. See [uploading to Google Cloud](/reference#uploading-to-google-cloud) for more information.

^4^ The proxy URL only supports attachments with a defined `width` and `height`, such as images and videos. For all other attachments, the proxy returns a 415 unsupported media type error.

^5^ This field will be missing if the attachment has not yet been scanned. In this case, a scan can be triggered with the [Explicit Content Scan](#scan-explicit-media) endpoint. If the field is present and set to `0`, the attachment is not eligible for a scan.

^6^ The `flags` field is received only and cannot be set directly. To set flags, use the `is_clip`, `is_thumbnail`, `is_remix`, and `is_spoiler` send-only fields.

^7^ When sending a clip, `is_clip`, `clip_created_at`, and `clip_participant_ids` are required. [See message types](#clips) for more information.

^8^ The `clip_participant_ids` and `application_id` fields are send-only. You will receive the `clip_participants` and `application` fields back when retrieving the [message](#message-object).

### Allowed Mentions Object

The allowed mention field allows for more granular control over mentions without various hacks to the message content. This will always validate against message content to avoid phantom pings (e.g. to ping everyone, you must still have "@everyone" in the message content) and check against user permissions.

###### Allowed Mention Types

| Value    | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| roles    | Controls role mentions                |
| users    | Controls user mentions                |
| everyone | Controls @everyone and @here mentions |

###### Allowed Mentions Reference

Due to the complexity of possibilities, we have included a set of examples and behavior for the allowed mentions field.

If `allowed_mentions` is _not_ passed in (i.e. the key does not exist), the mentions will be parsed via the content. This corresponds with existing behavior.

In the example below we would ping @here (and also @role124 and @user123)

```json
{
  "content": "@here Hi there from <@123>, cc <@&124>"
}
```

To suppress all mentions in a message use:

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone hi there, <@&123>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": []
  }
}
```

This will suppress _all_ mentions in the message (no @everyone or user mention).

The `parse` field is mutually exclusive with the other fields. In the example below, we would ping users `123` and role `124`, but _not_ @everyone. Note that passing a falsy value ([], `null`) into the `users` field does not trigger a validation error.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@&124>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users", "roles"],
    "users": []
  }
}
```

In the next example, we would ping @everyone, (and also users `123` and `124` if they suppressed
@everyone mentions), but we would not ping any roles.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["everyone"],
    "users": ["123", "124"]
  }
}
```

Due to possible ambiguities, not all configurations are valid. An _invalid_ configuration is as follows

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users"],
    "users": ["123", "124"]
  }
}
```

Because `parse: ["users"]` and `users: ["123", "124"]` are both present, Discord would throw a validation error.
This is because the conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously (they are mutually exclusive).

Any entities with an ID included in the list of IDs can be mentioned. Note that the IDs of entities not present in the message's content will simply be ignored.
e.g. The following example is valid, and would mention user 123, but _not_ user 125 since there is no mention of
user 125 in the content.

```json
{
  "content": "<@123> Time for some memes.",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "users": ["123", "125"]
  }
}
```

### Poll Object

The poll object has a lot of levels and nested structures. It was also designed
to support future extensibility, so some fields may appear to be more complex than
necessary.

###### Poll Structure

| Field             | Type                                                | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| question ^1^      | [poll media](#poll-media-structure) object          | The question of the poll                         |
| answers           | array[[poll answer](#poll-answer-structure) object] | The answers available in the poll                |
| expiry ^2^        | ?IS08601 timestamp                                  | When the poll ends                               |
| allow_multiselect | boolean                                             | Whether a user can select multiple answers       |
| layout_type       | integer                                             | The [layout type](#poll-layout-type) of the poll |
| results?          | [poll results](#poll-results-structure) object      | The results of the poll                          |

^1^ Only `text` is supported.

^2^ `expiry` is marked as nullable to support non-expiring polls in the future, but all polls have an expiry currently.

###### Poll Create Structure

This is the request object used when creating a poll across the different endpoints.
It is similar but not exactly identical to the main [poll](#poll-structure) object.
The main difference is that the request has `duration` which eventually becomes `expiry`.

| Field              | Type                                                | Description                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| question ^1^       | [poll media](#poll-media-structure) object          | The question of the poll                                             |
| answers            | array[[poll answer](#poll-answer-structure) object] | Each of the answers available in the poll (max 10)                   |
| duration           | integer                                             | Number of hours the poll should be open for (max 32 days, default 1) |
| allow_multiselect? | boolean                                             | Whether a user can select multiple answers (default false)           |
| layout_type?       | integer                                             | The [layout type](#poll-layout-type) of the poll (default `DEFAULT`) |

^1^ Only `text` is supported.

###### Poll Layout Type

Different layouts for polls will come in the future. For now though, this value will always be `DEFAULT`.

| Value | Name                   | Description                           |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1     | DEFAULT                | The default layout type               |
| ~~2~~ | ~~IMAGE_ONLY_ANSWERS~~ | ~~Poll answers can have only images~~ |

###### Poll Media Structure

The poll media object is a common object that backs both the question and answers.
For now, `question` only supports `text`, while answers can have an optional `emoji`.

| Field      | Type                                                  | Description                                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| text? ^1^  | string                                                | The text of the field (max 300 characters for question, 55 characters for answer) |
| emoji? ^2^ | partial [emoji](/resources/emoji#emoji-object) object | The emoji of the field                                                            |

^1^ `text` should always be non-`null` for both questions and answers, but do not depend on that in the future.

^2^ When creating a poll answer with an emoji, clients only needs to send either the `id` (custom emoji) or `name` (default emoji) as the only field.

###### Poll Answer Structure

The `answer_id` is a number that labels each answer.
As an implementation detail, it currently starts at 1 for the first answer and goes up sequentially.
We recommend against depending on this sequence.

Currently, there is a maximum of 10 answers per poll.

| Field         | Type                                       | Description            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| answer_id ^1^ | integer                                    | The ID of the answer   |
| poll_media    | [poll media](#poll-media-structure) object | The data of the answer |

^1^ When sending, this field is optional.

###### Poll Results Structure

In a nutshell, this contains the number of votes for each answer.
The `results` field may be not present in certain responses where, as an implementation detail, Discord does not fetch the poll results in the backend.
This should be treated as "unknown results", as opposed to "no results". You can keep using the results if you have previously received them through other means.
Due to the intricacies of counting at scale, while a poll is in progress the results may not be perfectly accurate.
They usually are accurate, and shouldn't deviate significantly—it's just difficult to make guarantees.
To compensate for this, after a poll is finished there is a background job which performs a final, accurate tally of votes.
This tally concludes once `is_finalized` is `true`. Polls that have ended will also always contain results.
If `answer_counts` does not contain an entry for a particular answer, then there are no votes for that answer.

| Field         | Type                                                            | Description                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| is_finalized  | boolean                                                         | Whether the votes have been precisely counted |
| answer_counts | array[[poll answer count](#poll-answer-count-structure) object] | The counts for each answer                    |

###### Poll Answer Count Structure

| Field    | Type    | Description                                    |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| id       | integer | The ID of the answer                           |
| count    | integer | The number of votes for this answer            |
| me_voted | boolean | Whether the current user voted for this answer |

  }
}
```

### Poll Result Notifications

Poll result notifications are sent as standard [messages](#message-object) in the channel with the `POLL_RESULT` [message type](#message-type).
The author of the message is the user who created the poll, and the message has a reference pointing to the original poll message.

These messages have a special [embed](#embed-object) structure which contains information about the poll results.
The custom embed fields below are collapsed as a list of key-value pairs into the `fields` array on the [embed object](#embed-object).

<Alert type="warn">

As [embed field values](#embed-field-structure) are strings, all below fields are serialized as strings, even if the type is specified as otherwise.

</Alert>

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages">
  Get Messages
</RouteHeader>

Returns a list of [message](#message-object) objects in the channel. Requires the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission if operating on a guild channel. If the current user is missing the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission in the channel then this will return no messages (since they cannot read the message history).

###### Query String Params

| before? | snowflake | Get messages before this message ID                  |
| after?  | snowflake | Get messages after this message ID                   |
| limit   | integer   | Max number of messages to return (1-100, default 50) |

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/channels/preload-messages">
  Preload Messages
</RouteHeader>

Preloads the last message sent in a series of private channels. Returns a list of [message](#message-object) objects without the `reactions` key.

###### JSON Body

| Field       | Type             | Description                                                |

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/guilds/{guild.id}/messages/search OR /channels/{channel.id}/messages/search">
  Search Messages
</RouteHeader>

Returns a list of [message](#message-object) objects without the `reactions` key that match a search query in the guild or channel. The messages that are direct results will have an extra `hit` key set to `true`. Requires the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission if operating on a guild channel.

<Alert type="warn">

If the guild/channel you are searching is not yet indexed, the endpoint will return a 202 accepted response. The response body will not contain any search results, and will look similar to an error response:

```json
{
  "message": "Index not yet available. Try again later",
  "code": 110000,
  "documents_indexed": 0,
  "retry_after": 2
}
```

You should retry the request after the timeframe specified in the `retry_after` field. If the `retry_after` field is `0`, you should retry the request after a short delay.

Due to speed optimizations, search may return slightly less results than the limit specified when messages have not been accessed for a long time.
Clients should not rely on the length of the `messages` array to paginate results.

Additionally, when messages are actively being created or deleted, the `total_results` field may not be accurate.

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages/{message.id}">
  Get Message
</RouteHeader>

Returns a specific [message](#message-object) object in the channel. Requires the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission if operating on a guild channel.

<Alert type="warn">

This endpoint is not usable by user accounts.

</Alert>

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages">
  Create Message
</RouteHeader>

<Alert type="warn">

Discord may strip certain characters from message content, like invalid unicode characters or characters which cause unexpected message formatting. If you are passing user-generated strings into message content, consider sanitizing the data to prevent unexpected behavior and using `allowed_mentions` to prevent unexpected mentions.

</Alert>

Posts a message to a text-based channel. Returns a [message](#message-object) object on success. Fires a [Message Create](/topics/gateway-events#message-create) Gateway event. See [message formatting](/reference#message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.

To create a message as a reply to another message, you can include a [`message_reference`](#message-reference-object) with a `message_id`. The `channel_id` and `guild_id` in the `message_reference` are optional, but will be validated if provided.

Files must be attached using a `multipart/form-data` body (or pre-uploaded to Discord's GCP bucket) as described in [Uploading Files](/reference#uploading-files).

###### Limitations

- When operating on a guild channel, the current user must have the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission.
- When sending a message with `poll`, the current user must have the `SEND_POLLS` permission.
- When sending a message with `tts` (text-to-speech) set to `true`, the current user must have the `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` permission.
- When creating a message as a reply to another message, the current user must have the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission.
  - The referenced message must exist and cannot be a system message.
- The maximum request size when sending a message is **100 MiB**.
- For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.

<Alert type="info">

Note that when sending a message, you must provide a value for **at least one of** `content`, `embeds`, `components`, `sticker_ids`, `activity`, `files[n]`, or `poll`.

Functionally identical to the [Create Message](#create-message) endpoint, but is used for DM channels in an OAuth2 context and has some additional parameters. Check there for more information.

A message can be sent between two users in the following situations:

- Both users are online and have a presence corresponding to the OAuth2 application (i.e. in the game)
- Both users are friends with each other
- Both users share a mutual guild with DMs allowed and have previously DM'd each other on Discord

<Alert type="warn">

This endpoint is only usable with an OAuth2 access token with the `dm_channels.messages.write` or `activities.invites.write` scope.

If the `activities.invites.write` scope is used, only the `activity` and `application_id` fields may be provided.

  Acknowledge Message
</RouteHeader>

Sets the channel's latest acknowledged message (marks a message as read) for the current user. Fires a Message Ack Gateway event.

The message ID parameter does not need to be a valid message ID, but it must be a valid snowflake. If the message ID is being set to a message sent prior to the latest acknowledged one, `manual` should be `true` or the resulting read state update should be ignored by clients (but is still saved), resulting in undefined behavior. In this case, `mention_count` should also be set to the amount of mentions unacknowledged as it is not automatically calculated by Discord.

When the `content` field is edited, the `mentions` array in the message object will be reconstructed from scratch based on the new content. The `allowed_mentions` field of the edit request controls how this happens. If there is no explicit `allowed_mentions` in the edit request, the content will be parsed with _default_ allowances, that is, without regard to whether or not an `allowed_mentions` was present in the request that originally created the message.

Returns a [message](#message-object) object. Fires a [Message Update](#message-object) Gateway event.

Refer to [Uploading Files](/reference#uploading-files) for details on attachments and `multipart/form-data` requests.
Any provided files will be **appended** to the message. To remove or replace files you will have to supply the `attachments` field which specifies the files to retain on the message after edit.

<Alert type="warn">

Starting with API v10, the `attachments` array must contain all attachments that should be present after edit, including **retained and new** attachments provided in the request body.
