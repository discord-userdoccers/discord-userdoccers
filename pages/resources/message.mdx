Represents a message sent in a channel within Discord.

###### Message Structure

<Alert type="warn">

`content`, `embeds`, `attachments`, and `components` will require a privileged intent in 2022. [Learn more here](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055).

\* The author object follows the structure of the user object, but is only a valid user in the case where the message is generated by a user or bot user. If the message is generated by a webhook, the author object corresponds to the webhook's id, username, and avatar. You can tell if a message is generated by a webhook by checking for the `webhook_id` on the message object.

\*\* The member object exists in [MESSAGE_CREATE](/topics/gateway#message-create) and [MESSAGE_UPDATE](/topics/gateway#message-update) events from text-based guild channels, provided that the author of the message is not a webhook. This allows bots to obtain real-time member data without requiring bots to store member state in memory.

\*\*\* The user objects in the mentions array will only have the partial `member` field present in [MESSAGE_CREATE](/topics/gateway#message-create) and [MESSAGE_UPDATE](/topics/gateway#message-update) events from text-based guild channels.

\*\*\*\* Not all channel mentions in a message will appear in `mention_channels`. Only textual channels that are visible to everyone in a lurkable guild will ever be included. Only crossposted messages (via Channel Following) currently include `mention_channels` at all. If no mentions in the message meet these requirements, this field will not be sent.

\*\*\*\*\* This field is only returned for messages with a `type` of `19` (REPLY) or `21` (THREAD_STARTER_MESSAGE). If the message is a reply but the `referenced_message` field is not present, the backend did not attempt to fetch the message that was being replied to, so its state is unknown. If the field exists but is null, the referenced message was deleted.

###### Message Types

<Alert type="warn">

Type `19` and `20` are only in API v8. In v6, they are still type `0`. Type 21 is only in API v9.

| fail_if_not_exists? | boolean   | when sending, whether to error if the referenced message doesn't exist instead of sending as a normal (non-reply) message, default true |

\* `channel_id` is optional when creating a reply, but will always be present when receiving an event/response that includes this data model.

#### Message Types

There are multiple message types that have a message_reference object. Since message references are generic attribution to a previous message, there will be more types of messages which have this information in the future.

###### Crosspost messages

- These are messages that originated from another channel (IS_CROSSPOST flag).
- These messages have all three fields, with data of the original message that was crossposted.

###### Channel Follow Add messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a channel is followed into the current channel (type 12).
- These messages have the `channel_id` and `guild_id` fields, with data of the followed announcement channel.

###### Pin messages

- These are automatic messages sent when a message is pinned (type 6).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, with data of the message that was pinned.

###### Replies

- These are messages replying to a previous message (type 19).
- These messages have `message_id` and `channel_id`, and `guild_id` if it is in a guild, with data of the message that was replied to. The channel_id and guild_id will be the same as the reply.
- Replies are created by including a message_reference when sending a message. When sending, only `message_id` is required.

###### Thread starter messsage

- These are the first message in a public thread. They point back to the message in the parent channel from which the thread was started (type 21)
- These messages have `message_id`, `channel_id`, and `guild_id`.
- These messages will never have content, embeds, or attachments, mainly just the `message_reference` and `referenced_message` fields.

| Field    | Type      | Description                                             |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| id       | snowflake | id of the channel                                       |
| guild_id | snowflake | id of the guild containing the channel                  |
| type     | integer   | the [type of channel](/resources/channel#channel-types) |
| name     | string    | the name of the channel                                 |

### Allowed Mentions Object

The allowed mention field allows for more granular control over mentions without various hacks to the message content. This will always validate against message content to avoid phantom pings (e.g. to ping everyone, you must still have `@everyone` in the message content), and check against user/bot permissions.

###### Allowed Mention Types

| Type              | Value      | Description                           |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Role Mentions     | "roles"    | Controls role mentions                |
| User Mentions     | "users"    | Controls user mentions                |
| Everyone Mentions | "everyone" | Controls @everyone and @here mentions |

| users        | list of snowflakes             | Array of user_ids to mention (Max size of 100)                                             |
| replied_user | boolean                        | For replies, whether to mention the author of the message being replied to (default false) |

###### Allowed Mentions Reference

Due to the complexity of possibilities, we have included a set of examples and behavior for the allowed mentions field.

If `allowed_mentions` is _not_ passed in (i.e. the key does not exist), the mentions will be parsed via the content. This corresponds with existing behavior.

In the example below we would ping @here (and also @role124 and @user123)

```json
{
  "content": "@here Hi there from <@123>, cc <@&124>"
}
```

To suppress all mentions in a message use:

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone hi there, <@&123>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": []
  }
}
```

This will suppress _all_ mentions in the message (no @everyone or user mention).

The `parse` field is mutually exclusive with the other fields. In the example below, we would ping users `123` and role `124`, but _not_ @everyone. Note that passing a `Falsy` value ([], null) into the "users" field does not trigger a validation error.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@&124>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users", "roles"],
    "users": []
  }
}
```

In the next example, we would ping @everyone, (and also users `123` and `124` if they suppressed
@everyone mentions), but we would not ping any roles.

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["everyone"],
    "users": ["123", "124"]
  }
}
```

Due to possible ambiguities, not all configurations are valid. An _invalid_ configuration is as follows

```json
{
  "content": "@everyone <@123> <@124> <@125> <@&200>",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "parse": ["users"],
    "users": ["123", "124"]
  }
}
```

Because `parse: ["users"]` and `users: [123, 124]` are both present, we would throw a validation error.
This is because the conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously (they are mutually exclusive).

Any entities with an ID included in the list of IDs can be mentioned. Note that the IDs of entities not present in the message's content will simply be ignored.
e.g. The following example is valid, and would mention user 123, but _not_ user 125 since there is no mention of
user 125 in the content.

```json
{
  "content": "<@123> Time for some memes.",
  "allowed_mentions": {
    "users": ["123", "125"]
  }
}
```

## Embed Limits

To facilitate showing rich content, rich embeds do not follow the traditional limits of message content. However, some limits are still in place to prevent excessively large embeds. The following table describes the limits:

###### Limits

All of the following limits are measured inclusively. Leading and trailing whitespace characters are not included (they are trimmed automatically).

| Field                                  | Limit                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| title                                  | 256 characters                                   |
| description                            | 4096 characters                                  |
| fields                                 | Up to 25 [field](#embed-field-structure) objects |
| [field.name](#embed-field-structure)   | 256 characters                                   |
| [field.value](#embed-field-structure)  | 1024 characters                                  |
| [footer.text](#embed-footer-structure) | 2048 characters                                  |
| [author.name](#embed-author-structure) | 256 characters                                   |

Additionally, the characters in all `title`, `description`, `field.name`, `field.value`, `footer.text`, and `author.name` fields must not exceed 6000 characters in total. Violating any of these constraints will result in a `Bad Request` response.

## Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages">
  Get Channel Messages
</RouteHeader>

Returns the messages for a channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the `VIEW_CHANNEL` permission to be present on the current user. If the current user is missing the 'READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY' permission in the channel then this will return no messages (since they cannot read the message history). Returns an array of [message](#message-object) objects on success.

<Alert type="info">

The before, after, and around keys are mutually exclusive, only one may be passed at a time.

</Alert>

###### Query String Params

| Field  | Type      | Description                              | Required | Default |
| ------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| around | snowflake | get messages around this message ID      | false    | absent  |
| before | snowflake | get messages before this message ID      | false    | absent  |

| limit  | integer   | max number of messages to return (1-100) | false    | 50      |

<RouteHeader method="GET" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages/{message.id}">
  Get Channel Message
</RouteHeader>

Returns a specific message in the channel. If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the 'READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY' permission to be present on the current user. Returns a [message](#message-object) object on success.

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages">
  Create Message
</RouteHeader>

<Alert type="warn">

Discord may strip certain characters from message content, like invalid unicode characters or characters which cause unexpected message formatting. If you are passing user-generated strings into message content, consider sanitizing the data to prevent unexpected behavior and utilizing `allowed_mentions` to prevent unexpected mentions.

</Alert>

Post a message to a guild text or DM channel. Returns a [message](#message-object) object. Fires a [Message Create](/topics/gateway#message-create) Gateway event. See [message formatting](/reference#message-formatting) for more information on how to properly format messages.

You may create a message as a reply to another message. To do so, include a [`message_reference`](#message-reference-object) with a `message_id`. The `channel_id` and `guild_id` in the `message_reference` are optional, but will be validated if provided.

Files must be attached using a `multipart/form-data` body as described in [Uploading Files](/reference#uploading-files).

###### Limitations

- When operating on a guild channel, the current user must have the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission.
- When sending a message with `tts` (text-to-speech) set to `true`, the current user must have the `SEND_TTS_MESSAGES` permission.
- When creating a message as a reply to another message, the current user must have the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` permission.
  - The referenced message must exist and cannot be a system message.
- The maximum request size when sending a message is `8 MiB`.
- For the embed object, you can set every field except `type` (it will be `rich` regardless of if you try to set it), `provider`, `video`, and any `height`, `width`, or `proxy_url` values for images.

<Alert type="info">

Note that when sending a message, you must provide a value for at **least one of** `content`, `embeds`, `components`, or `files[n]`.

<RouteHeader method="PATCH" url="/channels/{channel.id}/messages/{message.id}">
  Edit Message
</RouteHeader>

Edit a previously sent message. The fields `content`, `embeds`, and `flags` can be edited by the original message author. Other users can only edit `flags` and only if they have the `MANAGE_MESSAGES` permission in the corresponding channel. When specifying flags, ensure to include all previously set flags/bits in addition to ones that you are modifying. Only `flags` documented in the table below may be modified by users (unsupported flag changes are currently ignored without error).

When the `content` field is edited, the `mentions` array in the message object will be reconstructed from scratch based on the new content. The `allowed_mentions` field of the edit request controls how this happens. If there is no explicit `allowed_mentions` in the edit request, the content will be parsed with _default_ allowances, that is, without regard to whether or not an `allowed_mentions` was present in the request that originally created the message.

Returns a [message](#message-object) object. Fires a [Message Update](#message-object) Gateway event.

Refer to [Uploading Files](/reference#uploading-files) for details on attachments and `multipart/form-data` requests.
Any provided files will be **appended** to the message. To remove or replace files you will have to supply the `attachments` field which specifies the files to retain on the message after edit.

<Alert type="warn">

Starting with API v10, the `attachments` array must contain all attachments that should be present after edit, including **retained and new** attachments provided in the request body.
