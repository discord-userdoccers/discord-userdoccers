# Presences

A user's presence is their current status and activity. Presences are usually per-guild, but user accounts also receive overall user presences for [friends and implicit relationships](/resources/relationships#relationship-object) (depending on the `NO_AFFINE_USER_IDS` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities)).

### Session Object

Represents a specific Gateway session's presence information for the current user.

<Alert type="info">

In cases of ambiguity, e.g. when the user has multiple sessions with an active presence, a special session with a `session_id` value of `all`
will exist to represent the user's overall presence. This will be the presence that is broadcasted to other users.

The overall presence will always have unknown values for `client_info`.

^4^ These fields are send-only. For retrieving rich presence metadata, see [Get Activity Metadata](#get-activity-metadata). For retrieving secrets, see [Get Activity Secret](#get-activity-secret).

^5^ These fields are received only and cannot be set.

<Alert type="info">

Bots are only able to send `name`, `type`, `state`, and optionally `url`.

^3^ This action type is special in that instead of inviting others to a party, it asks existing party members to invite the user to join their party. Inviting users is done by [sending a message back](/resources/message#create-message) with a [rich presence invite](/resources/message#message-activity-object).

###### Activity Asset Image

Activity asset images are arbitrary strings which usually contain snowflake IDs or prefixed image IDs. Treat data within this field carefully, as it is user-specifiable and not sanitized.

To use an external image via media proxy, specify the URL as the field's value when sending. You will only receive the `mp:`-prefixed value via the Gateway.
