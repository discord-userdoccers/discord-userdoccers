# Presence Resource

A user's presence is their current status and activity. Presences are usually per-guild, but user accounts also receive overall user presences for [friends and implicit relationships](/resources/user#relationship-object) (depending on the `NO_AFFINE_USER_IDS` [Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities)).

^1^ The `name` of a `CUSTOM` activity should always be "Custom Status". The `name` of a `HANG` activity should always be "Hang Status".

^2^ URLs must start with `http://` or `https://`.

^3^ This field is not commonly used for traditional presences (i.e. presences sent by regular clients over the Gateway) and is instead used to differentiate between various headless and embedded activities.

^4^ In the case of the `HANG` type, this field should be one of the [hang status types](#activity-hang-status-type). If set to `custom`, the `details` field should be used to specify the custom text, and the `emoji` field should be used to specify the custom emoji.

^5^ These fields are send-only. For retrieving rich presence metadata, see [Get Activity Metadata](#get-activity-metadata). For retrieving secrets, see [Get Activity Secret](#get-activity-secret).

^6^ These fields are received only and cannot be set.

<Alert type="info">

Bots are only able to send `name`, `type`, `state`, and optionally `url`.

Inviting users is done by [sending a message back](/resources/message#create-message) with a [rich presence invite](/resources/message#message-activity-object).

###### Activity Asset Image

Activity asset images are arbitrary strings which usually contain snowflake IDs or prefixed image IDs. Treat data within this field carefully, as it is user-specifiable and not sanitized.

To use an external image via media proxy, specify the URL as the field's value when sending. You will only receive the `mp:`-prefixed value via the Gateway.

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/presences" supportsOAuth2="activities.write">
  Update Presence
</RouteHeader>

Updates the current user's mobile game activity. Returns a 204 empty response on success. Fires a Sessions Replace Gateway event.

<Alert type="info">

This endpoint is meant to be used by the Samsung Game launcher only. Because of this, all activities created through it will appear as an Android mobile session, and the [activity platform](#activity-object) will always be `samsung`.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warn">

If the application for the game you are trying to play is not yet cached, the endpoint will return a 202 accepted response. The response body will look similar to an error response:

```json
{ "message": "Application not yet available. Try again later", "code": 110001, "retry_after": 4000 }
```

You should retry the request after the timeframe specified in the `retry_after` field. If the `retry_after` field is `0`, you should retry the request after a short delay.
