# Presence Resource

### Presence Object

A user's presence is their current status and activity. Presences are usually per-guild, but user accounts also receive overall user presences for [friends and implicit relationships](/resources/user#relationship-object) (depending on the [`NO_AFFINE_USER_IDS` Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities)).

###### Activity Asset Image

Activity asset images are arbitrary strings which usually contain snowflake IDs or prefixed image IDs. Treat data within this field carefully, as it is user-specifiable and not sanitized.

To use an external image via media proxy, specify the URL as the field's value when sending. You will only receive the `mp:` prefix via the Gateway:
