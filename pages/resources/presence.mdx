# Presence Resource

### Presence Object

A user's presence is their current status and activity. Presences are usually per-guild, but user accounts also receive overall user presences for [friends and implicit relationships](/resources/user#relationship-object) (depending on the [`NO_AFFINE_USER_IDS` Gateway capability](/topics/gateway#gateway-capabilities)).

^3^ This field can only be sent and is not received. For retrieving rich presence metadata, see [Get Activity Metadata](#get-activity-metadata).

<Alert type="info">

Bots are only able to send `name`, `type`, `state`, and optionally `url`.
