# Clan Resource

Clans are an extension of guilds that are intended for small gaming communities, offering users the ability to display a global badge representing their group.
They require an application to join, and thus have [guild previewing](/resources/guild#guild-previewing) disabled and [member verification manual approval](/resources/guild#manual-approval) by default.
