# Teams

Teams are groups of developers on Discord who want to collaborate on apps. On other platforms, these may be referred to as "organizations", "companies", or "teams". Discord went with the name Teams because it best encompassed all the awesome conglomerates of devs that work together to make awesome things on Discord. Also, none of you ever got picked for kickball in gym class, so now you get to be on a team.

Teams allow you and other Discord users to share access to apps. No more sharing login credentials in order to reset the token on a bot that your friend owns but you work on, or other such cases.

For game developers, this means that you can get your engineers access to your app for credentials they may need, your marketing folks access to store page management, and your finance people access to sales and performance metrics.
