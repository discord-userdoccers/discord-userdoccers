# Users Resource

Users in Discord are generally considered the base entity. Users can spawn across the entire platform, be members of
guilds, participate in text and voice chat, and much more. Users are separated by a distinction of "bot" vs "normal". Although they are similar, bot users are automated users that are attached to an application, "owned" by another user. Unlike normal users, bot users do
_not_ have a limitation on the number of guilds they can be a part of.

### Usernames and Nicknames

Discord enforces the following restrictions for usernames, display names, and nicknames:

1.  Names can contain most valid unicode characters. We limit some zero-width and non-rendering characters.
2.  Usernames must be between 2 and 32 characters long.
3.  Display names and nicknames must be between 1 and 32 characters long.
4.  Webhook names must be between 1 and 80 characters long.
5.  Names are sanitized and trimmed of leading, trailing, and excessive internal whitespace.

The following restrictions are additionally enforced for usernames and display names:

1.  Usernames cannot contain the following substrings: '@', '#', ':', '\```'.
2.  Usernames and display names cannot be: 'everyone', 'here', 'system message', or contain 'discord'.

The following restrictions are additionally enforced for webhook names:

1.  Webhook names cannot contain the following substrings: 'clyde'.

[Migrated usernames](#unique-usernames) are subject to a new set of restrictions in addition to the above:

1.  Migrated usernames can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters, underscores (`_`), and periods (`.`). Uppercase characters, spaces, dashes (`-`), and other special characters are not allowed.
2.  Migrated usernames cannot have two or more consecutive periods (`..`).
3.  Migrated usernames are unique to each user, and no two users can share the same username.

There are other rules and restrictions not shared here for the sake of spam and abuse mitigation, but the majority of users won't encounter them. It's important to properly handle all error messages returned by Discord when editing or updating names.

### Unique Usernames

Discord's username system is changing. Discriminators are being removed and new, unique usernames (`@name`) and display names are being introduced. Internally, this migration is referred to as "pomelo". You can read more details about how the changes to the username system affect user accounts in the [general Help Center article](https://dis.gd/usernames). To learn how it impacts bots specifically, you can read the [Developer Help Center article](https://dis.gd/app-usernames).

A user's legacy `username#discriminator` tag will still be usable to [send friend requests](#send-friend-request), and will be available as a [profile badge](#profile-badge-structure) for migrated users.

#### Identifying Migrated Users

Pomelo will rollout to users over time rather than all at once. The value of a single zero (`0`) in the [`discriminator` field on the user object](#user-object) indicates that the user has ~~been pommeled~~ migrated to the new username system. Note that the discriminator for migrated users will _not_ be 4-digits like a standard discriminator (it is `0`, not `0000`). The value of the `username` field will become the migrated user's unique username.

#### Migrating

Users can only migrate their account to pomelo if they are in the rollout. A user is in the rollout if they have `pomelo` in the [`disclose` field on the Ready Supplemental event](/topics/gateway-events#ready-supplemental) and are [in the `2023-03_pomelo` user experiment](/topics/experiments#user-experiments).

To migrate, users should first [check if the username they want is available](#get-pomelo-eligibility), and then [migrate their account to that username](#create-pomelo-migration). If the username they want is not available, they can [get a list of suggested usernames](#get-pomelo-suggestions) to choose from.

#### Display Names

As part of pomelo, user accounts can define a non-unique display name. This value is a new nullable `global_name` field with a max length of 32 characters.

For bots, the display name will be the same as their application's name.

#### Default Avatars

For users with migrated accounts, default avatar URLs will be based on the user ID instead of the discriminator. The URL can be calculated using `(user_id >> 22) % 6`. For non-migrated accounts, the URL can be calculated using `discriminator % 5`.

^1^ Required for changing `username`, `discriminator`, `email`, `date_of_birth`, or `new_password`.

^2^ Setting this sets the `nsfw_allowed` field of the user (based on whether they are over 18).

^3^ Changing the account password invalidates all active tokens. Don't fret though, as the `token` key in the response will be valid.

^4^ This value can be obtained by requesting a verification code with the [Modify User Email](#modify-user-email) endpoint, and then using the [Verify User Email Change](#verify-user-email-change) endpoint.

^5^ If using pomelo, the `username` field must be unique across Discord, and `discriminator` cannot be changed. Else, the `username` and `discriminator` fields must be unique across Discord, and changing the username changed may cause the discriminator to be randomized. See the [section on Discord's new username system](#unique-usernames) for more information.
