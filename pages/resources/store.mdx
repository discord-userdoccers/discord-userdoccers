# Store

Discord store resources have a long and convoluted history.

The store was originally built to support game developers selling games and in-game items on Discord, as well as GameSDK features.
While this was deprecated soon after, the store infrastructure remained in place, fully functional.
It was then used internally to power the Discord Nitro subscription service, as well as other ventures such as the now-defunct paid sticker packs.

Now, it has been repurposed to support guild and application monetization features, such as guild products and application subscriptions.
As Discord has returned to gaming with the release of the Social SDK, it is now again being used to support sales of in-game items.

While the store infrastructure is still in use, most of the new features being built with it offer newer APIs to manage and interact with them.
Certain new features may require using these new APIs to function properly, and may not be fully compatible with the older store APIs, even though
they are using [SKUs](#sku-object) and [store listings](#store-listing-object) under the hood.

### SKU Object

A purchasable item or group of items in Discord.

###### SKU Structure

SKU objects can either be localized or unlocalized. Localized SKUs only serialize strings and pricing for the user's location, while unlocalized SKUs serialize all strings and pricing for all locales.
All objects serialized in the SKU inherit this behavior.

### Store Listing Object

A listing for a marketable item on Discord. Tied to a single SKU.

###### Store Listing Structure

Store listing objects can either be localized or unlocalized. Localized listings only serialize strings and pricing for the user's location, while unlocalized listings serialize all strings and pricing for all locales.
All objects serialized in the listing inherit this behavior.
