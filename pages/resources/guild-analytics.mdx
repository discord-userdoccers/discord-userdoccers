# Guild Analytics

Insights are a data monitoring and analytics tool that Discord provides to help community managers understand their guild's performance and how their members are interacting with it.

For growth, activation, engagement, and channel following analytics, only data from the last 120 days are available for non-partner and non-verified guilds.
Audience and welcome screen analytics are based on members who visited the server in the last 28 days. Users who opted-out of analytics tracking will not show up in the data.

<Alert type="info">

To protect user privacy, unless a given audience group has more than 50 members, it will not be shown as a distinct result and may be grouped into “Other.”
