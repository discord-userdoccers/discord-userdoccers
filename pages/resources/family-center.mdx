# Family Center

[Family Center](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/14155043715735-Family-Center-for-Parents-and-Guardians) acts as Discord's parental controls solution to allow parents to monitor the activities of their teens on Discord. They do not allow parents to view message content, but Discord does share:

- Users messaged (DMs and Group DMs)
- Users called (DMs and Group DMs) in the last week
- Friends added in the last week
- Guilds joined in the last week
- Guilds the teen has sent messages to in the last week

A maximum of 8 accounts can be connected to a single parent.

<Alert type="warn">

Discord automatically removes all connected parents the month the teen turns 18 (as indicated by the age they entered after being prompted for their birthday). After this, viewing the Family Center from the teen's account will no longer show the option to display a QR code for connection, and attempts to generate a new code via the API will fail.

</Alert>

## Definitions

In line with the API, instead of referring to Family Center users as "parents" or "teens" and links as "family", "connected teens", or "my family", the API terminology will be used instead.

- **Requestor:** This is the user that _sends_ a link request to a different user and acts as the user the linked user is connected to. Can be viewed as the "parent."
- **Linked user:** This is the user that _receives_ or _accepts_ a link request sent by the requestor and acts as the user the "parent" can view the activity of. Can be viewed as the "teen."
- **Link:** Represents the connection between requestor and linked user.
