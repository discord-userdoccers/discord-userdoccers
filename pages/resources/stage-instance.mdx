# Stage Instance Resource

A _Stage Instance_ holds information about a live stage.

## Definitions

Below are some definitions related to stages.

- **Liveness:** A stage channel is considered _live_ when there is an associated stage instance. Conversely, a stage channel is _not live_ when there is no associated stage instance.
- **Speakers:** A participant of a stage channel is a _speaker_ when their [voice state](/resources/voice#voice-state-object)
  is not `suppress`ed, and has no `request_to_speak_timestamp`.
- **Moderators**: A member of the guild is a _moderator_ of a stage channel if they have all of the following [permissions](/topics/permissions#permissions):
  - `MANAGE_CHANNELS`
  - `MUTE_MEMBERS`
  - `MOVE_MEMBERS`
- **Topic**: This is the blurb that gets shown below the channel's name, among other places.
- **Public**: A stage instance is public when it has a `privacy_level` of `PUBLIC`. While a guild has a public stage instance:
  - Lurkers may join any stage channel with a public stage instance.
  - Users in the stage can have the stage show in their [activities](/topics/gateway#presence).
  - [Invites](/resources/invite#invite-object) to the stage channel will have the `stage_instance` field.

## Auto Closing

When a stage channel has no speakers for a certain period of time (on the order of minutes) the stage instance will be automatically deleted.
