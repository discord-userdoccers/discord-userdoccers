## Definitions

Below are some definitions related to stages.

- **Liveness:** A Stage channel is considered _live_ when there is an associated stage instance. Conversely, a Stage channel is _not live_ when there is no associated stage instance.
- **Speakers:** A participant of a Stage channel is a _speaker_ when their [voice state](/resources/voice#voice-state-object)
  is not `suppress`ed, and has no `request_to_speak_timestamp`.
- **Moderators**: A member of the guild is a _moderator_ of a Stage channel if they have all of the following [permissions](/topics/permissions#permissions):
  - `MANAGE_CHANNELS`
  - `MUTE_MEMBERS`
  - `MOVE_MEMBERS`
- **Topic**: This is the blurb that gets shown below the channel's name, among other places.
- **Public**: A Stage instance is public when it has a `privacy_level` of `PUBLIC`. While a guild has a public Stage instance:
  - The guild will be lurkable.
  - Lurkers may join any Stage channel with a public Stage instance.
  - Users in the Stage can have the Stage show in their [activities](/topics/gateway#presence).
  - [Invites](/resources/invite#invite-object) to the Stage channel will have the `stage_instance` field.

## Auto Closing

When a Stage channel has no speakers for a certain period of time (on the order of minutes) it will be automatically deleted.
