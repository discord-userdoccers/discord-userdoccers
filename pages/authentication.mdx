# Authentication

A major distinguishing feature of user accounts is that you retrieve authentication tokens by logging in through a classic email/password combination. However, the full login & registration flow is quite complex, and involves several steps.

<Alert type="warn">

Special care should be taken when handling user credentials and implementing Discord's login & registration flow. Discord does not take kindly to spam in their authentication endpoints, and an improper implementation or suspicious requests can lead to account termination.

</Alert>

## Fingerprints

Discord uses fingerprints to persist experiments throughout the authentication flow. For more information about fingerprints, see the [relevant experiment documentation](/topics/experiments#fingerprints).

If the client is unauthenticated, a fingerprint should be generated using [Get Experiment Assignments](/topics/experiments#get-experiment-assignments) and included in the `X-Fingerprint` header as well as any applicable `fingerprint` JSON parameters until authentication is complete.

## Sessions

Discord uses sessions to track the user's authentication state. A session is created when the user logs in and is invalidated when the user logs out or the session expires.
Sessions are unique to a single authentication token and keep track of the last location they were used from. Suspicious sessions may be flagged by Discord and lead to the account being locked, requiring the user to reset their password.

The authentication session ID corresponding to the current Gateway session is given in the [`auth_session_id_hash` field in the Ready event](/topics/gateway-events#ready).
If the current Gateway session's authentication session ever changes (e.g. due to a password reset), the client will receive an [Auth Session Change](/topics/gateway-events#auth-session-change) Gateway event.

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/auth/sessions/logout" mfa>
  Logout Auth Sessions
</RouteHeader>

Invalidates a list of authentication sessions. Returns a 204 empty response on success.

###### JSON Params

| Field             | Type          | Description                                |

| session_id_hashes | array[string] | The session ID hashes to invalidate (1-64) |

## Login

The login process is the first step in authenticating a user.

To log in, a client must first use the [Login Account](#login-account) endpoint with the user's email/phone number and password.
If the user has multi-factor authentication enabled, the client must use the [Verify MFA Login](#verify-mfa-login) endpoint to complete the login process after a successful response.

If a known [JSON error code](/topics/opcodes-and-status-codes#json-error-codes) is returned, the client must handle the error accordingly (e.g. prompt the user to undelete their account or verify their phone number).
If a form body error is returned, the client should display the error message to the user.

Once the user is logged in, the client should store the authentication token to avoid having to log in again in the future.

### Passwordless Login

An alternative to the traditional email/password login flow is the WebAuthn Conditional UI flow.
This [allows users to log in using an WebAuthn device](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredential/isConditionalMediationAvailable) (e.g. a security key) instead of a password.

To use this flow, the client must first generate a challenge using the [Start Passwordless Login](#start-passwordless-login) endpoint. After the user completes the WebAuthn challenge, the client must use the [Finish Passwordless Login](#finish-passwordless-login) endpoint to complete the login process.
Using this flow, you must still take care to handle any errors as outlined above.

### Authentication Handoff

The handoff process is used to securely transfer the user's authentication state between two clients, commonly used to authenticate the Discord website from a native client and vice-versa.

To handoff authentication to another client, the source client must first use the [Create Handoff Token](#create-handoff-token) endpoint to generate a handoff token.
The token should then be passed to the target client, which can use the [Exchange Handoff Token](#exchange-handoff-token) endpoint to retrieve a new authentication token.

Note that handoff tokens are single-use and valid only for the IP address they were generated from.

### Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/auth/login" unauthenticated>
  Login Account
</RouteHeader>

Retrieves an authentication token for the given credentials.

<Alert type="info">

If this endpoint is requested with a valid authentication token, a success response will be returned irrespective of the request body.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warn">

When first logging into an account (without MFA enabled) from a new location, Discord may reject the login request and require the user to verify the login attempt via email or phone.

If logging in via email, the user will receive a link that redirects to the official Discord client with a verification token present in the URL's fragment (e.g. `https://discord.com/authorize-ip#token=Wzg1Mjg5MjI5NzY2MTkwNjk5MywiMTI3LjAuMC4x8J+RvSJd.kdI8zppMIeTZsIBva3zZslaz_58`).

If logging in via phone number, the request will fail with a [`70007` JSON error code](/topics/opcodes-and-status-codes#json-error-codes), and the user will receive a verification code via SMS.
A verification token should be retrieved by verifying the phone number. {/* todo: link this here */}

After [IP authorization](#authorize-ip-address) with this verification token, the login request should be retried. A new CAPTCHA challenge should not be required.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warn">

If the user's account is disabled by Discord, the login request will fail with a special error response body, similar to a success response:

```json
{
  "user_id": "852892297661906993",
  "suspended_user_token": "ODUyODkyMjk3NjYxOTA2OTkz.Hcj0Nl.YEJSsjeq_vJKLpOofd5QMksqw32e"
}
```

Suspended authentication tokens cannot be used as a regular authentication token. They can only be used to view account standing and appeal the account's suspension.

```json
{ "suspended_user_token": "ODUyODkyMjk3NjYxOTA2OTkz.Hcj0Nl.YEJSsjeq_vJKLpOofd5QMksqw32e" }
```

Suspended authentication tokens cannot be used as a regular authentication token. They can only be used to view account standing and appeal the account's suspension.

## Register

Potential users must register an account before they are able to use most of the platform.

The full registration process involves choosing a username & display name, providing an email address or phone number, setting a password, and providing a date of birth.
However, the client can choose to skip some of these steps to provide a more streamlined registration experience, such as when viewing an invite or gift code.

To register, the client should first [retrieve the user's location metadata](#get-location-metadata) to determine whether explicit consent is required.
Then, they can use the [Register Account](#register-account) endpoint to create a new account with the provided credentials.
Throughout the process, they can use the [Get Unique Username Suggestions](#get-unique-username-suggestions) to get username suggestions for the user's display name and [Get Unique Username Eligibility](#get-unique-username-eligibility) endpoints to validate the username's availability.

Once the user is registered, the client should store the authentication token to avoid having to log in again in the future.

### Phone Registration

Clients can alternatively register an account using a phone number. To do so, the client must first use the [Register by Phone Number](#register-by-phone-number) endpoint to send a verification code to the user's phone number.
Then, the client must verify the phone number using the received code before completing the registration using the [Register Account](#register-account) endpoint as usual. {/* todo: link this here */}

### Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/auth/register" unauthenticated>
  Register Account
</RouteHeader>

Creates a new account and retrieves an authentication token for the given credentials.

<Alert type="info">

If this endpoint is requested with a valid authentication token, a success response will be returned irrespective of the request body.

</Alert>

<Alert type="warn">

Accounts should only be registered for a user to immediately use. Upon registration, the client should immediately connect to the Gateway using the retrieved authentication token.
Suspicious account creations may be flagged by Discord and require [additional verification steps](/resources/user#required-action-type) or lead to immediate account termination.

## Account Recovery

Account recovery is a feature intended for post-takeover recovery after an attacker has already changed the victim's email, password, phone number or MFA settings.

Upon an email change, Discord will email the victim about the change and give them the option to start the account recovery process.
The email will include a link that redirects to the official Discord client with a revert token present in the URL (e.g. `https://discord.com/wasntme/BIGJWTHERE`).
This token is valid for two days.

This token can be used with the [Revert Account](#revert-account) endpoint to revert the account back to the previous settings.
Upon completion, the current phone number is removed from the account and all phone numbers previously associated with the account are blacklisted. This prevents a follow-up takeover via [sim-jacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam).

### Endpoints

<RouteHeader method="POST" url="/auth/revert">
  Revert Account
</RouteHeader>

Recovers an account after account takeover. This endpoint will:

- Invalidate the revert token used
- Invalidate all authorization tokens and active Gateway sessions associated with the account
- Set the account's email back to the original
- Set the account's password to the one provided
- Remove MFA from the account
- Remove and blacklist all phone numbers previously associated with the account

<Alert type="warn">

This process will fail if the account was deleted beforehand (e.g. by anti-spam or a Discord employee) or the original email was assigned to a different account.

</Alert>

## MFA Verification

In some cases, you may be required to verify your identify using multi-factor authentication before performing certain sensitive actions.
When this occurs, you'll receive a 401 unauthorized error with a special error response body:

}
```

To verify, you must use the [Verify MFA](#verify-mfa) endpoint with the ticket retrieved from the error response.
The retrieved verification JWT can then be inserted into the `X-Discord-MFA-Authorization` header and the original request can be retried.

Upon successful elevation, the verification JWT will be returned in a `__Secure-recent_mfa` cookie that temporary bypasses MFA for the next 5 minutes.
