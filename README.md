# Discord Unofficial User API Documentation

This repo is an attempt at documenting the unsupported user side of the Discord API, used by the [official client](https://discord.com/app) and [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), amongst others.

This means this documentation is focused on the API as it is used by non-bot users, namely with user and bearer authentication tokens. **Most bot-only endpoints that are not usable with user/bearer tokens are generally out of scope and will not be documented here.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The success of this project depends on the community's contributions. If you have any knowledge of the Discord API, please consider contributing to this project. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is not affiliated with or endorsed by Discord in any way. It is a community effort to document the API as it is used by regular user accounts, and is not an official source of information.

**This is a very early work-in-progress. [Contributions](/CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome!**
