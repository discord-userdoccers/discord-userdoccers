# Discord Unofficial User API Documentation

This repo is an attempt at documenting the unsupported user side of the Discord API, used by the [official client](https://discord.com/app) and [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), amongst others. 

This means this documentation is focused on the API as it is used by non-bot users, namely with user and bearer authentication tokens. **Most bot-only endpoints that are not usable with user/bearer tokens are generally out of scope and will not be documented here.**

### ⚠️ Note
This documentation is not affiliated with or endorsed by Discord in any way. It is a community effort to document the API as it is used by regular user accounts, and is not an official source of information.

**This is a very early work-in-progress. [Contributions](/CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome!**
