# Contributing

This documentation strives to not only be accurate, but ***consistent***. It has many conventions to aid predictability and readability. These may be seen in the official documentation, but are not followed closely.

This document is meant as a guide to help you get started. If you are not sure on how to do something, _check other sections of the documentation_ to see how it is done.

## Basics

### Markdown

The documentation is written in a superset of Markdown called MDX. This allows for the use of JSX in the documentation, which is used for endpoints, alert boxes, and more.

Endpoints are defined like so:

```jsx
<RouteHeader method="GET" path="/users/@me" supportsAuditReason unauthenticated supportsOAuth2="scope">
  Get Current User
</RouteHeader>
```

Alert boxes are defined like so:

```jsx
<Alert type="warn">
  This endpoint deletes Discord. Do not use it.
</Alert>
```

### Formatting

Within tables:

- Base types should be documented as `snowflake`, `string`, `integer`, or `boolean`. If the type is an object, it should be documented as `foo object` and `foo` should be linked to the object's documentation. If the type is an array, it should be documented as `array[foo object]` and `foo` should be linked to the object's documentation.
- If a field is optional, it should be documented as `foo?`. If a field is nullable, the type should be documented as `?foo`.
- If a field is deprecated, it should be documented as `foo *(deprecated)*` (or ommited if unnecessary and not yet documented).
- In descriptions, capitals should be used, but periods should not be used. Abbreviations like "ID", "SKU", "URL", etc. should always be capitalized. Descriptions such as "The ID of the user" are preferred over "User ID" or "The user's ID".

###### Invite Channel Structure

| Field       | Type                                                      | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id          | snowflake                                                 | The ID of the channel                                          |
| type        | integer                                                   | The [type of channel](/resources/channel#channel-types)        |
| name        | ?string                                                   | The name of the channel (1-100 characters)                     |
| recipients? | array[partial [user](/resources/user#user-object) object] | The recipients of the DM; only the `username` field is present |
| icon?       | ?string                                                   | The DM's [icon hash](/reference#cdn-formatting)                |

## Enums

Enums are used to define a set of constants. They are used in many places in the documentation, and should be defined at the end of their relevant object section like so:

If enums are used in multiple places, they should be defined by the most relevant section.

###### Visibility Type

| Value | Name     | Description                                      |
| ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | NONE     | Invisible to everyone except the user themselves |
| 1     | EVERYONE | Visible to everyone                              |

Note that **Type** is used, *not* **Types** like in the documentation.

For enums that have strings as values, the name can be skipped like so:

###### Platform Type

| Value   | Description                   |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| web     | Represents the web platform   |
| mobile  | Represents a mobile platform  |
| desktop | Represents a desktop platform |
