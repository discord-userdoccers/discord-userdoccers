# Remote Authentication (Desktop)

In the context of remote authentication, the desktop client is the device that wants to be authenticated by the already logged-in mobile client.
See the [introduction](/remote-authentication/intro) for more information.

## Remote Authentication Gateway

The desktop implementation of remote authentication uses WebSocket connections, operating similarly to the [Gateway](/topics/gateway#connections) connection.
However, it has a separate set of payloads and events, as well as a simplified packet structure.

###### Gateway Versions

| Version | Status       | Default  |
| ------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 2       | Available    | âœ“ Client |
| 1       | Discontinued |          |

### Gateway Payloads

In practice, opcodes are lower-cased with under_scores joining each word in the name. For instance, [Nonce Proof](#nonce-proof) would be `nonce_proof`.

For readability, opcodes in the following documentation are typically left in Title Case.

Remote authentication Gateway event payloads are flat packets, with the `op` field indicating the type of payload, and the rest of the fields being the payload data.

###### Example Gateway Payload

```json
{
  "op": "hello",
  "timeout_ms": 142637,
  "heartbeat_interval": 41250
}
```

### Connecting

For the remote authentication Gateway, the URL you can use to open a WebSocket connection [is static](#endpoint).

When connecting to the URL, you must explicitly pass the API version as a query parameter. For example, `wss://remote-auth-gateway.discord.gg/?v=2` is a URL a client may use to connect to the Gateway.

<Alert type="warn">

When connecting to the remote authentication Gateway, you must specify an `Origin` header, set to one of `https://discord.com`, `https://ptb.discord.com`, or `https://canary.discord.com`.
If the origin is invalid, the connection will be rejected. This is to prevent malicious websites from using remote authentication to hijack user accounts.

</Alert>

###### Endpoint

```
wss://remote-auth-gateway.discord.gg/
```

###### Query String Params

| Field | Type    | Description                             |
| ----- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| v     | integer | [API Version](#gateway-versions) to use |

### Handshaking

Once you open a connection to the Gateway, you will receive an [Opcode Hello](#hello-structure) payload, which contains the heartbeat interval and timeout duration. See the [heartbeating](#heartbeating) section for more information.

At this point, you should generate a 2048-bit RSA-OAEP keypair that will be used in further communications. This will be verified by the Gateway using a nonce proof. An example in Python pseudocode would be:

```py
import base64
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization, hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa, padding

private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
    public_exponent=65537,
    key_size=2048,
)
public_key = private_key.public_key()
```

###### Hello Structure

| Field              | Type    | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| heartbeat_interval | integer | The minimum interval (in milliseconds) the client should heartbeat at                                              |
| timeout_ms ^1^     | integer | The lifespan of the remote auth session (in milliseconds) before the connection is closed, typically a few minutes |

^1^ When the timeout duration passes, the Gateway will close with a [`4003` close code](#gateway-close-event-codes).

###### Example Hello

```json
{
  "op": "hello",
  "timeout_ms": 142637,
  "heartbeat_interval": 41250
}
```

Upon receiving the [Opcode Hello](#hello-structure) payload, you should immediately send an [Opcode Init](#init-structure) containing the public key that all future communication will be encrypted with.

An example in Python pseudocode would be:

```py
spki = public_key.public_bytes(
    encoding=serialization.Encoding.DER,
    format=serialization.PublicFormat.SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
)
encoded_public_key = base64.b64encode(spki).decode("utf-8")
```

###### Init Structure

| Field              | Type   | Description                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| encoded_public_key | string | The base64-encoded SPKI of the client's 2048-bit RSA-OAEP public key |

###### Example Init

```json
{
  "op": "init",
  "encoded_public_key": "MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAo2PGAKj4v6r6sPJtgJe2eIDCM8uEHKpYCSDmp+pun9vqiqPt4pDToS1vGtwTwc5hKKqtIo+I/5veBpGWSD/veuB0xVb/JbkPn847Q+mXAb6c9vRMJVkA7l9GaZdN49U5bnGJi009aNBoy9cAcP/19H6TLpHmZ9RojnqGqlCUdyAiqceTDTzPqov4ST3GJSyKPydL3ZVpPf5P/PGyNfISuESKA2CxGCoBvB4H6/FH7cwSFelyqhwwHPZcyxBjF/3iXx+k1PdS01y0NoTRun4p76bE9rWnecIWONPFvCkby8Xs/OqQ8QcAoLkfVj5L29Ut1+Kmwwfg3nzc4glZa6RuTwIDAQAB"
}
```

If the Gateway accepts the public key, it will respond with an [Opcode Nonce Proof](#nonce-proof-structure-receive) payload, which contains a nonce that you must decrypt with your private key.

###### Nonce Proof Structure (Receive)

| Field           | Type   | Description                                                     |
| --------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| encrypted_nonce | string | The base64-encoded nonce encrypted with the client's public key |

###### Example Nonce Proof (Receive)

```json
{
  "op": "nonce_proof",
  "encrypted_nonce": "GrOYi2wz9athue0mTNrdlnWGqJYkqu8tPe2uGr9V7CRwqVWDjgUI06gsPKszkORgB92P1P84V04fo7hG0tkQ/kDVNbVguACKfE4AIUUQXQFSkTVaGbZ2+FsItsoqOd+955EvkBK2oMz+kWlYILTQcISip9g5ZrY9SoKQvk7HDW9DliSteZivHzXQOc5RyecyeexOcV8oyC1zTk+uyVUTv3g7fcZ1Y81AK6u4+hvnEKGjOyEn+lbOotkNwcMC02xyVBX3IysSuNXf/f8/6gPMBNUHXEtlvhYx9AMCsPrPKkiilV7HpLN3oIvAfsZnyxbYcNiC6YS7z7VIPRaXEWW76w=="
}
```

You should then send an [Opcode Nonce Proof](#nonce-proof-structure-send) payload containing a base64URL-encoded representation of the decrypted nonce's SHA-256 digest.

An example in Python pseudocode would be:

```py
nonce = private_key.decrypt(
    base64.b64decode(encrypted_nonce),
    padding.OAEP(mgf=padding.MGF1(algorithm=hashes.SHA256()), algorithm=hashes.SHA256(), label=None),
)
nonce_proof = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(
    hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256()).update(nonce).finalize()
).decode("utf-8").rstrip("=")
```

###### Nonce Proof Structure (Send)

| Field | Type   | Description                                                 |
| ----- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| nonce | string | The base64URL-encoded SHA-256 digest of the decrypted nonce |

###### Example Nonce Proof (Send)

```json
{
  "op": "nonce_proof",
  "nonce": "1xFdzsYTFMtZuUarGNKpBpMANyqNpRXpDFaxl8wFeQBUnVuY60d9j-or80f36xusAVTmUL90jwHrxMVPGZXJ8ahqDAiXByEOjkreJXZdPRbnvDkHHyqUP0QgHQBvrKq5Cba9-SDO8pFSc9T1YMWGut7n34xx6txX-QR7wDcZAoghq5EBl04WRlnt1DWfX2wMA7NuL1GFIZdw10IedBZ13E72BXnDasX97XMX_ldbxKwee6ABGf18zde2oHbTqw"
}
```

<Alert type="info">

If any part of the handshake fails, the Gateway will close with a [`4001` close code](#gateway-close-event-codes).

</Alert>

If the Gateway accepts the nonce proof, it will respond with an [Opcode Pending Remote Init](#pending-remote-init-structure) payload, which indicates that the key exchange was successful and the remote auth session is ready.

At this point, the fingerprint can be used to [create a remote auth session](/remote-authentication/mobile#create-remote-auth-session) on the mobile client.
The fingerprint is typically communicated using a QR code with the following format: `https://discord.com/ra/<fingerprint>`.

<Alert type="info">

Clients should verify the sent fingerprint is the same as the base64URL-encoded SHA-256 digest of the client's public key as a security measure.
If the fingerprints do not match, the client should close the connection and reconnect.

</Alert>

###### Pending Remote Init Structure

| Field       | Type   | Description                                                     |
| ----------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fingerprint | string | The base64URL-encoded SHA-256 digest of the client's public key |

###### Example Pending Remote Init

```json
{
  "op": "pending_remote_init",
  "fingerprint": "UZ0-kOVzXDZTFVV5_QlpURSO2BQHrtkKWHNpIGoDI0k"
}
```

### Heartbeating

In order to maintain your WebSocket connection, you need to continuously send heartbeats at the interval determined in [Opcode Hello](#hello-structure):

This heartbeat interval is the minimum interval you should heartbeat at. You can heartbeat at a faster interval if you wish.

After receiving [Opcode Hello](#hello-structure), you should send [Opcode Heartbeat](#example-heartbeat) every elapsed interval:

<Alert type="info">

The first heartbeat may be offset by a value between 0 and `heartbeat_interval` in order to prevent too many clients from connecting at the same time (which could cause an influx of traffic).

</Alert>

In return, you will be sent back an [Opcode Heartbeat ACK](#example-heartbeat-ack).
If a client does not receive a heartbeat ACK between its attempts at sending heartbeats, this may be due to a failed or "zombied" connection.
The client should immediately terminate the connection and reconnect.

###### Example Heartbeat

```json
{ "op": "heartbeat" }
```

###### Example Heartbeat ACK

```json
{ "op": "heartbeat_ack" }
```

### Finalizing

Once the mobile client [creates a remote auth session](/remote-authentication/mobile#create-remote-auth-session) (scans the QR code), the Gateway will send an [Opcode Pending Ticket](#pending-ticket-structure) payload, which contains the information of the user that is attempting to authenticate.

###### Pending Ticket Structure

| Field                  | Type   | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| encrypted_user_payload | string | The base64-encoded [user payload](#user-payload-structure) encrypted with the client's public key |

###### User Payload Structure

The user payload is a colon-separated string in the format `852892297661906993:0:05145cc5646fbcba277b6d5ea2030610:dolfies`.

It contains the following fields (see the [user](/resources/user#user-object) object for more information):

| Field         | Type      | Description                                                              |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id            | snowflake | The ID of the user                                                       |
| discriminator | string    | The user's stringified 4-digit Discord tag                               |
| avatar        | ?string   | The user's [avatar hash](/reference#cdn-formatting)                      |
| username      | string    | The user's username, may be unique across the platform (2-32 characters) |

###### Example Pending Ticket

```json
{
  "op": "pending_ticket",
  "encrypted_user_payload": "MeJm9TeLa9S+/gUYZlm69TQqT3eqz1sG6f5Ym84lGCH7Hde/Dpv/knXX+wWp8WeyLPHYGn1smpTaGxwHmuvee1IZv8ybP9WeVscsBnrXpO7Fg2aT3hZJfPStncJxI0Uq+JhjqQ1V2lLuhoraeBrZbl/e0CBNhv0wmIGzFow6G078MQvikg20Jr+/2wRgY/buXuipqfW9RYIZUyr3Dl+MRW8EodKU3SOBgqaVpHETDLXkmb6rsvYU+O78iUu+cvTK3A0GkajxmhJ2nfg79iQBuLU6qJm7sN9mHy2uKAExa5TUJfeeCqXjTr1uROozlyBmCMjeP+Srrg37r0y2pkjYCg=="
}
```

At this point, the desktop client will either receive an [Opcode Pending Login](#pending-login-structure) or [Opcode Cancel](#example-cancel) event.
Both of these events will result in the Gateway closing with a [`1000` close code](#gateway-close-event-codes). If neither of these events occur (the mobile client does not finish or cancel), the Gateway will eventually timeout and close with a [`4003` close code](#gateway-close-event-codes).

If the mobile client [finishes remote auth](/remote-authentication/mobile#finish-remote-auth), the Gateway will send an [Opcode Pending Login](#pending-login-structure) payload, which indicates that the authentication was successful.

###### Pending Login Structure

| Field  | Type   | Description                                                                   |
| ------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ticket | string | The ticket that can be used to [obtain a token](#exchange-remote-auth-ticket) |

###### Example Pending Login

```json
{
  "op": "pending_login",
  "ticket": "ODUyODkyMjk3NjYxOTA2OTkz.HYoNwT.1X5Qs3Sd2Z2sDf3sFFFwd22_MccjcmwY"
}
```

If the mobile client [cancels remote auth](/remote-authentication/mobile#cancel-remote-auth), the Gateway will send an [Opcode Cancel](#example-cancel) payload, which indicates that the authentication was canceled.

###### Example Cancel

```json
{ "op": "cancel" }
```

## Endpoints
