# Opcodes and Status Codes

## Gateway

All Gateway events in Discord are tagged with an opcode that denotes the payload type. Your connection to the Gateway may also sometimes close. When it does, you will receive a close code that tells you what happened.

## HTTP

The API will return semantically valid HTTP response codes based on the success of your request. The following table can be used as a reference for response codes it will return.

###### HTTP Response Codes

| 400 (BAD REQUEST)         | The request was improperly formatted, or the server couldn't understand it.                                |
| 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)        | The `Authorization` header was missing or invalid.                                                         |

| 429 (TOO MANY REQUESTS)   | You are being rate limited, see [Rate Limits](/topics/rate-limits).                                        |
| 502 (GATEWAY UNAVAILABLE) | There was not a gateway available to process your request. Wait a bit and retry.                           |
| 5xx (SERVER ERROR) ^1^    | The server had an error processing your request.                                                           |

^1^ 502, 504, 507, 522, 523, 524 should be retried with a backoff. The number of failed requests can be specified with the `X-Failed-Requests` header. Whether you retry other 5xx errors is up to you.

## JSON

Along with the HTTP error code, the API can also return more detailed error codes through a `code` key in the JSON error response. The response will also contain a `message` key containing a more friendly error string. Some of these errors may include additional details in the form of [Error Messages](/reference#error-messages) provided by an `errors` object.

<Alert type="info">

A special `40333` JSON error code is returned if your request is blocked by CloudFlare. This may be due to a malformed request or improper user agent. The response resembles a normal error structure:

```json
{ "message": "internal network error", "code": 40333 }
```
